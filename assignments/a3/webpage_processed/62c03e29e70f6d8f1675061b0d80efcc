HANNIBAL BURESS - dudes in my neighborhood that have handlebar mustaches

   @hannibalburess http://on.cc.com/1BU4c7D

   There's a lot of dudes in my neighborhood that have handlebar
   mustaches.

   Which is cool if you want to have a handlebar mustache.

   But don't try to have a conversation with me like you don't have a
   handlebar mustache.

   Subway car design

      In 1909, the first subway car with side doors in the U.S. was put into
      service in New York City. The Interborough Rapid Transit Company placed
      an 8-car train in service from Lenox Avenue to 148th Street. The side
      doors, positioned four feet from each end of the car, were opened and
      closed by a pneumatic-lever system. The cars cost $12,000 each. These
      doors were the invention of James McElroy of the Consolidated Car
      Heating Company. Although there had been prior instances of trains
      running underground, when the Interborough Rapid Transit Company opened
      on 27 Oct 1904, it was the first to establish a rapid transit subway in
   the U.S.
