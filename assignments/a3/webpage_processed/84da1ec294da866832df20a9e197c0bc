Customer Reviews

So cute and great for cat lovers!


   by Melbaby808

   I wrote a review a long time ago for ideas and one of them actually got
   into the game! It was a pool for house 2 but came out with a house
   three with a big pool!!! So I'm happy but I'd like more houses
   please!!! This is the game I play when I'm bored! At first I started
   out wanting the cheetah cub ( because the cheetah is my favorite animal
   ) but now I got the cub and now I want the bob cat and tiger!!!!!!!!!!
   I have 226 diamonds!$!$!$! I pretend that I live in house two the
   little computer desk with the cat play house is my room the room with
   the dog on the bed it is the dogs room and because I'm a cub my two
   parents sleep in the bunk beds! When ever I exit my house there is a
   guy caring this vase I smash it every time he never gets to bring a
   vase home because of me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Lol bye!

Amazing but not perfect


   by Bobby ferg

   This is a great game to play if you don't have wifi or if you are doing
   nothing for some time. The game is pretty addicting since you can break
   lots of stuff and cause certain chain reactions. But I think the
   highlights is that each new area brings new things to do and you will
   be interested for a long time. But there is a few problems like the
   places start to feel repetitive alone there uniqueness and another bad
   thing about this game is that the replay value isn't very high as once
   you done everything you think you need to do, then you leave the area
   until you want to change the timed score challenge. But I feel like
   this is still a really good game and is definitely worth a try.

Still my #1!


   by Frostwolf101

   Okay, so this is a re-write of a review I wrote all loooooooong time
   ago. I loved this app and recommended a pool and more houses and stuff.
   So I just got the new update and it's EPIC! Just what I asked for.
   L‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏èVE the pool and everything else new. So fun and creative. I can't
   believe how amazing this app is! If anyone tries to say this app is
   bad, they're wrong. Anyway, I still want more though. EXPAND THE MAP
   PLEASE! A fun thing you could do is maybe make a cat poundthing and you
   could bust other cats out! But don't get me wrong, I'm just trying to
   give you more ideas! This is already an awesome app and I just want the
   map to be as big as possible! Thanks for reading!
