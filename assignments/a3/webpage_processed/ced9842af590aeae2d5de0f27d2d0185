Story highlights

     * The Denver Broncos win Super Bowl 50, defeating the Carolina
       Panthers in a game close until nearly the end
     * Peyton Manning, at 39, is the oldest starting quarterback in Super
       Bowl history
     * Lady Gaga sings the national anthem; Coldplay, Beyonce and Bruno
       Mars rock the halftime show

   Santa Clara, California (CNN)If this was the final game of Peyton
   Manning's 18-year career, he couldn't have scripted the ending much
   better.

   A 2-yard rushing touchdown from running back C.J. Anderson -- in
   addition to a defensive score and three field goals from kicker Brandon
   McManus -- gave the Denver Broncos a 24-10 win over the Carolina
   Panthers in Super Bowl 50 in front of 71,088 at Levi's Stadium in Santa
   Clara, California. Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, who had two
   strip-sack fumbles of Panthers quarterback Cam Newton, was named Super
   Bowl Most Valuable Player.

   Manning, at 39, is the oldest starting quarterback in Super Bowl
   history. Going into Sunday, he hadn't confirmed if Super Bowl 50 would
   be his last game. But it sure felt that way. And like his boss, Broncos
   general manager and executive vice president of football operations
   John Elway, Manning can ride off into the sunset after securing his
   second championship in his career.

   After the win, Manning was noncommittal on his future.

   "You know, I'll take some time to reflect," Manning said. "I have a
   couple of priorities first. I want to go kiss my wife and my kids, I
   want to go hug my family. I'm going to drink a lot of Budweiser
   tonight. I promise you that. I'm going to take care of those things
   first, and say a little prayer to thank the man upstairs for this great
   opportunity. I'm just very grateful."

   Manning is also the first quarterback to win a Super Bowl with two
   different teams. He also won Super Bowl XLI when he was with the
   Indianapolis Colts.

   With the win, Manning became the first NFL quarterback with 200 career
   wins (186 regular season and 14 postseason). He had been tied with
   [154]Brett Favre, a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of
   2016, with 199.

   "Being on two different teams, winning a Super Bowl with each team, I'm
   proud of that," Manning said.

Manning -- good enough for the win

   Manning didn't play flawlessly, but he did enough, which is all a
   suffocating Broncos-led defense has needed this season. Manning's line:
   13 of 23 passing for 141 yards with one interception and a lost fumble.

   Manning's 18th -- and perhaps final -- season has been his most
   challenging.

   He was benched for the first time in his career, which was a loss to
   the Kansas City Chiefs in November. While backup Brock Osweiler filled
   in, Manning missed six games because of a partially torn plantar fascia
   in his left foot.

   But in Week 17, Manning returned, coming off the bench to lead Denver
   to a win over the San Diego Chargers to clinch a first-round bye in the
   playoffs.

   Manning called it "a unique season."

   "I certainly knew with this defense that this team would have a
   chance," Manning said. "Our defense has just been from the get-go,
   they've been nothing but awesome. Being hurt, the struggle early in the
   season wasn't a lot of fun, so I was grateful to get back healthy and
   to try to play my part these last couple of weeks."

   It started well for the Broncos (15-4) on their opening drive, capped
   by a 34-yard McManus field goal to take an early 3-0.

   It was a different story for Carolina (17-2).

   The Panthers, having lost just once coming into this game, were
   accustomed to having their way offensively.

   Carolina had the league's top offense this year -- averaging 31.3
   points per game in the regular season and a whopping 40 points per game
   in the postseason. Newton was responsible for 79.3% of the Panthers'
   offensive scores this season heading into Sunday.

   But Carolina didn't face a defense like Denver's all season. The
   Broncos lead the NFL in total defense, pass defense and sacks. Newton
   got to see -- and feel -- that up close. He was sacked seven times,
   tying a Super Bowl record.

   The one that was the most costly came in the first quarter, Carolina's
   second turn on offense. On Carolina's 15-yard line, Miller forced a
   Newton fumble on the strip sack for an 11-yard loss while defensive end
   Malik Jackson scooped up the ball for the score to give Denver a 10-0
   lead. It was the first fumble recovery for a touchdown in a Super Bowl
   in 22 years.

   Later in the second quarter, Carolina coughed up the football again.
   This time, Broncos safety Darian Stewart forced a fumble from Panthers
   fullback Mike Tolbert; inside linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered.

   Courtesy of a huge mistake by Broncos' cornerback Aqib Talib, the
   Panthers were able to capitalize and get on the scoreboard with a
   1-yard run by running back Jonathan Stewart. What transpired the play
   before was a face mask personal foul penalty by Talib.

   Talib had a terrible first half with three penalties, two of which were
   personal fouls.

   But Carolina squandered an opportunity early in the third quarter when
   a 44-yard field goal attempt by Graham Gano hit the right upright.
   Later in the quarter, Newton threw an interception into the hands of
   safety T.J. Ward, quashing a promising drive that had Carolina in
   Denver territory.

   Gano hit a 39-yarder with 10:26 remaining to cut the deficit to 16-10,
   but late in the period, Miller forced his second fumble from Newton.
   Ward recovered and returned it to the Carolina 4-yard line. Anderson
   iced the game with Denver's first offensive touchdown of the day with
   3:08 left.

   On the day, Miller had 2.5 sacks, six total tackles, two forced
   fumbles, two hurries and a pass defensed.

   "I just wanted to key into my guy, key into my tackle, the center, key
   into Cam," Miller said on his strip sacks. "His cadence is definitely
   one of the hardest to get down in the National Football League. We just
   keyed in. That's the type of defense that we've been playing all year
   long."

   Newton, named the 2015 NFL MVP on Saturday, finished the day 18 for 41
   for 265 yards and those three turnovers (two fumbles, one
   interception).

   Following the game, Newton for the most part kept his answers terse.

   "We had our opportunities," Newton said. "There wasn't nothing special
   that they did. We dropped balls. We turned the ball over, gave up
   sacks, threw errant passes. That's it. They scored more points than we
   did."

   When asked to put his disappointment into words, all Newton would say
   was, "We lost."

   It's not often a defensive player wins Super Bowl MVP. This marks the
   10th time in Super Bowl history that a defensive player has received
   the honor. Linebacker Malcolm Smith of the Seattle Seahawks in Super
   Bowl XLVIII was the last defensive player to receive the honor.

   "Played a heck of a football game," Panthers coach Ron Rivera said of
   Miller. "He deserves to be the Super Bowl MVP."

   McManus, meanwhile, stayed perfect in the postseason, going 10 for 10
   overall. He finished the day with three field goals for 34, 33 and 30
   yards.

Fantastic football weather in California

   Game-time temps hovered around 70 degrees at kickoff in a beautiful day
   in Santa Clara. The game also had a throwback feel.

   With kickoff at 3:30 p.m. local time (6:30 p.m. ET), the game basked in
   daylight for the first half, making it feel reminiscent all the way
   back to Super Bowl I -- then called the "First AFL-NFL World
   Championship Game" -- which was held in Los Angeles on January 15,
   1967.

   The crowd -- mostly pro-Broncos fans judging by the amount of orange in
   the stands, though both fan bases still were well-represented -- filled
   up Levi's Stadium quickly.

   Both sides got their vocal chords warmed up when the NFL honored all of
   the previous Super Bowl MVPs. Manning was in the locker room when his
   name was called, but that didn't stop a huge roar from the crowd.

   Meanwhile, when New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady appeared
   when his name was announced (he has three Super Bowl MVP awards), the
   crowd booed lustily.

   It then turned into [155]adoration for Lady Gaga, who belted out a
   stirring rendition of the national anthem. The energy level also
   remained at a fever pitch [156]for the halftime show featuring
   Coldplay, Beyonce and Bruno Mars.

   CNN's Jill Martin reported and wrote this story from Santa Clara,
   California. CNN's Forrest Brown contributed from Atlanta.
