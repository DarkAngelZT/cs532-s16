Denver 24 Carolina 10; VFLs Manning, Jackson, Colquitt Win Super Bowl 50

   Posted on February 8, 2016

   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. —VFLs and Denver Broncos [61]Peyton Manning, [62]Malik
   Jackson and [63]Britton Colquitt are Super Bowl 50 champions.

   The Broncos took a 24-10 win over the Carolina Panthers on Sunday in
   Super Bowl 50 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.

   VFL [64]Chris Scott is on the Panthers and saw action at left guard.

   [65]FULL OFFICIAL GAME BOOK OF STATS – SUPER BOWL 50

   Manning went 13-of-23 for 141 yards and one interception in his fourth
   Super Bowl appearance. He also completed a pass to Bennie Fowler in the
   end zone for a two-point conversion on Denver’s final touchdown with
   1:01 remaining.

   Manning also earned his 200th career win (regular season and postseason
   included), becoming the first player to reach that milestone. He is
   also the only quarterback in NFL history to have led two different
   franchises to Super Bowl Championships. He previously quarterbacked the
   Indianapolis Colts to a 29-17 win over the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl
   XLI on Feb. 4, 2007.

   Jackson was one of the game’s stars as he recovered a fumble by Cam
   Newton in the end zone in the first quarter to give the Broncos a 10-0
   lead. Jackson’s fumble recovery in the end zone made him the first VFL
   to score in the Super Bowl since Jamal Lewis scored for the Baltimore
   Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV on Jan. 28, 2001 (2000 NFL season).He
   finished with five tackles in the win.

   Colquitt played a major role in the win, flipping the field with each
   punt. He punted eight times for 45.9 yards with two punts inside the
   20-yard line. Colquitt was also the holder on Brandon McCmanus’ three
   field goals (3-for-3) and one extra point.

   Super Bowl 50 Notes
     * For the 24th time in 25 years the Super Bowl featured a VFL.
     * For the seventh-consecutive year, Tennessee had at least two VFLs
       in the Super Bowl. In each of those seven years, a VFL has been on
       each team in the game.
     * With the Broncos’ win, a VFL has been on the winning team 44 times.
     * Manning is the only quarterback in NFL history to have led two
       different franchises to Super Bowl championships.
