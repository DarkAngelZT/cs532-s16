Testimonial bottom

   testimonial-guy-small-white

   “Pass the time trying to guess the next price move [...] In return you
   earn points, and points mean prizes” – Financial Times Alphaville

   eric-mattson

   “[SparkProfit] is innovating at the nexus of several major trends … to
   try and change the future of investing” – Eric Mattson, CEO of Finovate

How it works

We’re looking for the world’s top trading talent. Challenge yourself on this
fun, free app that’s simple to use but difficult to master.

Spark Profit fits your schedule because you can make long or short
predictions, then review or cancel them at any time. As your skills improve,
you will get more points. Compete against other players for higher score and
rewards.

Paying for talent

   We’ve invented something we call “crowd-sourced alpha”. It means we
   combine our member’s predictions to guess where the markets will move.
   By giving access to a wide and diverse talent pool, we aim to make the
   markets more efficient and democratic.

   Of course, this is pretty clever. That’s why we’ve already applied for
   two patents and have more planned.

   What it really means is that we provide everything you need and take
   all the risk, while you get the credit for predicting with skill.

Getting started

   You can make as many predictions as you like, and after reaching a high
   enough score you will start to earn rewards. It couldn’t be simpler. We
   even carry points over each week to help you hit your targets.

   Register for free, take a two minute tutorial and practice for as long
   as you like. When you’re ready simply go and make your first
   prediction. We want to find and nurture natural talent from around the
   world. That is why Spark Profit gradually introduces all the skills and
   knowledge you need to be successful.
