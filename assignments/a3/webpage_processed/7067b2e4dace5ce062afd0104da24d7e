   Londoners feared a terrorist attack when a double-decker bus apparently
   exploded in central London. However, it was just a stunt for a new
   movie. Pictures of the artificial blast instigated lively discussions
   online.

   The actual reason for the ‘blast’ was a movie-in-the-making, “The
   Foreigner”, staring Jackie Chan. But some people who saw the bus
   explode with their own eyes either live or online expressed horror,
   thinking terrorism was to blame.

     Incredible this was central London this morning

     What's this? Nothing on MSN as far as I can see. Terrorism??
     — Bob Smith (@Schmiffy12) [43]February 7, 2016

     PS I was freaked too. Looked very real
     — Sophie Kinsella (@KinsellaSophie) [44]February 7, 2016

     Noticed this on Lambeth bridge as we passed. Got v worried until we
     realised they were filming!

   The incident reminded others of the 2005 terror attacks in London.

     If you're filming a London bus blowing up and tweeting it out, SAY
     IT'S FAKE. Some of us lived through 7/7 waiting to see who'd died.
     — failnaut (@failnaut) [48]February 7, 2016

   A number of people blamed the film crew and authorities for not giving
   the general public a heads-up.

     Hey film types next time you blow up a bus on Lambeth Bridge maybe
     tell us first so children in park aren't freaked?

     — Sophie Kinsella (@KinsellaSophie) [50]February 7, 2016

   However, others pointed out that there had indeed been a notice about
   the event.

     [51]@failnaut they told businesses & residents in the area, their
     responsibility to pass the info on not the filmmakers.

   The Marine Policing Unit in London also posted a prior warning.

     Don't be concerned if you hear or see explosions on Lambeth Bridge
     today, filming is taking place including loud special effects.
     — MPSonthewater (@MPSonthewater) [54]February 7, 2016

   Other posts were more positive with users saying there was no reason to
   be scared as it was obvious it was being done for a movie.

     Personally find the outrage of the Lambeth Bridge thing hilarious,
     quite obvious it was for filming
     — Jess (@Allmmurr) [55]February 7, 2016

   Some argued with the above point of view, saying that hiring
   loudspeakers or marshals would have eliminated fears. They insisted
   that explicit indication that the explosion was a fake was required
   from anyone spreading the video online.

     [56]@KinsellaSophie A few loudspeaker warnings too might have
     avoided too many people being freaked out!
     'If you see anything suspicious....'
     — HughSykes (@HughSykes) [57]February 7, 2016

     [58]@HughSykes[59]@PA Understand that, but when another action movie
     shot there, they stationed marshals along the river. Was more
     obvious.
     — Sophie Kinsella (@KinsellaSophie) [60]February 7, 2016

     [61]@FireLambeth[62]@TowerRNLI you need to be a bit more responsible
     with this clip. It's not clear that it's filming, it could be
     distressing.
     — Mike J (@magic_in_london) [63]February 7, 2016

   The Marine Policing Unit said that Lambeth Bridge where the explosion
   took place was temporary closed.

     This is the aftermath of a London bus being blown up for a film
     shoot today. Lambeth Bridge remains closed.
