Take the Leap to a Healthy Lifestyle + a Fitbit Giveaway!

   January 29, 2016 by [26]Christine [27]124 Comments

   It’s January (albeit the end of January!) and a time when many people
   are committed to making a few changes in their lives and take the leap
   to a healthy lifestyle.

   Though we are active on the farm and we eat healthy, there’s always
   room for improvement.  Since my work involves me working from my home
   office for a good part of the day, driving to meetings and sitting in
   meetings, I’ve started doing my workouts in the morning before everyone
   wakes up and setting my alarm on the hour when I am working from home
   to remind me to get up and walk around, take the dogs for a quick walk,
   or just do something that requires a few extra steps and activity.
   winter on the farm

   I don’t usually talk about weight loss or what I’m doing because a) I
   don’t want to make a big deal out of it, and b) I am worried I may
   sabotage what I’m doing if I publicly announce it.  Perhaps those
   worries are silly, but it is what it is.  I guess I should be happy
   that I lost 7 lbs in the past month and a bit.  I know it doesn’t seem
   like much, but it’s a start.  With my newly diagnosed medical
   condition, I seemed to have reached a plateau a while ago.  I’m
   actually not as concerned about the pounds, but more of the “feel”.  I
   feel more energetic.  I had been feeling really exhausted a few weeks
   ago.  Ever since I started workouts in the wee hours of the morning
   (along with my daily 1 hour walks) and incorporated the hourly alarm to
   remind me to get up and away from my work desk for a few minutes, I’ve
   noticed a difference in energy.

Take the leap to a healthy lifestyle

   Just recently, I heard about [28]Ben Pobjoy‘s [29]inspiring story.   He
   lost almost 100 lbs by integrating movement into his life.

     Last year, Ben decided it was time to make a change and focus on his
     health. With the help of technology and his own two feet, he took
     the leap and his efforts paid off – he walked more than 5,800
     kilometres, lost a whopping 100 pounds and gave out 1,000 sandwiches
     along the way while gaining a healthier life!

   TELUS was inspired by Ben’s weight loss story and want to share it with
   Canadians to inspire them too. [30]Watch it for yourself and help us
   share his story and the idea of taking the leap this year through
   [31]Facebook.

   In 2011, TELUS became the premier founding partner of the 60 Minute
   Kids’ Club, an in-school, community-supported physical activity
   program. Through TELUS’ support, the free program provides children in
   kindergarten to grade eight with concrete tools, support and
   accountability to be physically active for 60 minutes every day, for
   life. Participants learn about nutrition, hydration and other healthy
   lifestyle choices, while tracking their progress online

   For every share of Ben’s video [32]on Facebook, TELUS will donate $5 to
   [33]60 Minute Kids’ Club, a free in-school program providing children
   in kindergarten through grade 8 with concrete tools to be physically
   active for 60 minutes every day, for life.

About Health and Fitness at TELUS

   At TELUS, they care about the health of Canadians and believe in the
   power of technology to help them take the leap and become healthier and
   happier.

   Fitness gear and wearables have the ability to motivate Canadians and
   help them stay on track with their health goals:

   The majority (57 per cent) of consumers said the ability to
   self-monitor was a major factor in their purchase of a fitness wearable
   ([34]Nielsen)

   Fifty-two per cent of wearable owners primarily use their devices to
   stay motivated to exercise and stay healthy (MaRS)

   Nearly three-quarters of current exercise app users are more active
   than those who stopped or never used their apps ([35]Journal of Medical
   Research)

   At a time when most of us are thinking about fresh starts, healthier
   living and general self-improvement, TELUS has your back. Not only does
   TELUS offer one of the most comprehensive selections of fitness and
   health-oriented gear, they also have trained experts to help you
   understand how to get the most out of your fitness and health trackers.

   TELUS offers some of the most sought-after fitness and health gear on
   the market and has an entire team dedicated to keeping a pulse on the
   latest and greatest wearable accessories out there.

   Whether you’re looking for a simple all-in-one solution for tracking
   daily activity like the [36]Fitbit Charge HR, trying to get a better
   sleep with a product like the [37]Withings Aura Smart Sleep System, or
   looking to pump up your workout with the right music with the
   [38]Jaybird X-2 Sport Wireless BUDS, TELUS has curated the most
   sought-after accessories to suit your needs.

How TELUS helps me take the leap to a healthier life

   I was using my [39]Fitbit Charge HR and absolutely loved it.  I liked
   that my Fitbit tracked all my steps, calories burned, floors climbed,
   kilometers walked, active minutes, etc. fitbit

   I’m sad to say that Little One [DEL: lost  :DEL] misplaced my
   [40]Fitbit and I haven’t been able to use it in the past few months.
   She wanted to wear it to see how many steps she made a day and forgot
   where she put it.  Now if we don’t find it, I’m going to just have to
   buy another one.

   I have to say that my Fitbit has been instrumental in keeping me on
   track and motivated.  I loved checking out how many steps I did a day
   and made it a point to try to get in at least 10,000 a day.

   Other tech I am using to help with health is the [41]Fitbit Aria WiFi
   Smart Scale.  The Aria tracks not only weight, but body fat percentage,
   BMI and when uploaded to smartphone, the info paints a picture of
   long-term progress.

   To view TELUS’ lineup of health and fitness tech gear, visit
   [42]www.telus.com/betteryou.

   How can TELUS help you take the leap?

   Resolutions can be hard to stick to. According to the [43]Journal of
   Clinical Psychology, only 64 per cent of people continue their New
   Year’s workouts into February. This year, TELUS wants to help Canadians
   “take the leap” to a happy and healthier version of themselves – and
   help them stay motivated all year long.

   [44]TELUS Learning Centre Experts are trained to set customers up with
   the right fitness tech gear so that it’s easy to get started on their
   health goals for the year. They can help set up your new device, show
   you how it works, how to make use of the data they collect and how to
   get the most out of your investment.

       I love that variety of options and price points for trackers. I
       think trackers are a must so you have accurate information, and
       information is power. Knowing how active you actually are, or what
       you are actually eating is the only way to make a plan and stick to
       it. SMART goals – (Specific Measurable, Achievable, Relevant &
       Realistic, and Time bound or Timely – Specific time in which to
       achieve goals).

       Having a FitBit would totally motivate me to stay on my feet and
       keep walking. I tend to sit on my butt to much and that needs to
       change. My girlfriend has one and she swears by it !

            So awesome, Craig!! My Fitbit was recently lost (my Little One
            wanted to wear it for an afternoon because she was curious…and
            the she lost it!! GRRR). I used to set the alarm on my Fitbit
            so I got up and walked around or did exercises at my desk.
            Desk work is brutal for not being able to get in more
            activity, so I’ve found setting an alarm helpful. Fitbit is
