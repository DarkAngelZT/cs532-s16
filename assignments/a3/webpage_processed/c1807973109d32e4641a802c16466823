   Callystro is an award winning enterprise focused towards providing
   effective learning solutions for better learning outcomes in low cost
   income schools. With our experience in the education field, what we
   realised that when given access to digital content, children mainly
   skip all the one way video content and jump to games and activities.
   Based on this, we decided to build something which is created on the
   basic premise of games and activities. Hence we converted the entire
   Indian curriculum into a pool of 350 games which cover all competencies
   for EVS and Maths until grade 8.

   Our solution, CoBELS has reached out to over 7000 learners both in the
   urban and rural segment.

   Callystro partnered with Parikrma Humanity Foundation around 3 years
   back to pilot this solution. Now we are its proud partners and have
   seen great results among the learners. We carried out a detailed imapct
   assessement exercise at the school where we found improvement in scores
   in 90% students of grades 3 and 4. Teachers say that it has helped
   improve their ASSET scores too. Whats more, children love to play and
   they keep coming back for more.

   So far we have given the solution for free to to Parikrma. However now
   we want to license it out to them. However it being a fund supported
   school, they are not able to pay us the license cost.

   Hence we are looking out for people who can fund game based learning
   education for 100 kids. The highly subsidized license cost for each
   child is Rs. 400/year which is just Rs. 33 a month. Looking for people
   to support a child for 3 years at the cost of Rs. 1200.

   Lets provide a fun and engaging environment for all children. If we are
   able to catch the attention of the child, learning will definitely come
   by.
   If the campaign is a success, we can look out to support so many other
   schools which have the intent but not the resources to implement this.

   Look at our detailed impact portal:

   http://callystro.com/affordable-schools/

   All supporters will get 1 yr free license to our online version of the
   solution which they can share with any kid to experience game based
   learning @ http://www.cobels.in

   Look forward to all the support! Thanks!
