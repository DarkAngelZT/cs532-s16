Ticket price scandal - enough is enough, English football should hang its
head in shame

Deluded executives, arrogant multi-millionaire players, faceless agents - all
examples of how money is all that matters and the fans are the ones to suffer

   Ticket price scandal - football should hang its head in shame
   Protest: Liverpool fans make their feelings clear to chief executive

   Liverpool fans announce a [52]walk-out in protest against ticket prices
   and football’s head-burying exercise begins.

   The executives who sanction the increases, with no concept of how a fee
   of £77 will detach them from their own fanbase, bury their heads.

   The Premier League executives of whom the top seven from 20 clubs
   blocked a proposal to cap the cost of away tickets to £30 bury their
   heads.

   Empty seats at Anfield

   [53]• Five ways English football can help fans now

   The Premier League footballers - who took £828 million in wages out of
   the top tier of English football last season - bury their heads.

   The Professional Football Association, funded to the tune of £17.3
   million from broadcast revenue, who think it’s fair for a
   £250,000-a-week player to pay the same £150-a-year subscription as a
   £250-a-week player, bury their heads.

   Interactive: [54]Premier League ticket prices

   Some ex-players don’t. Of course they don’t. A bit of populism on
   Twitter or on TV won’t go amiss if a bandwagon is on the move – but
   they’re less vocal on the PFA chairman Gordon Taylor handing himself a
   pay increase from £1.4 million to almost £3.4 million-a-year (a 140 per
   cent increase). On that, they too will bury their heads.

   Gordon Taylor handed himself a 140 per cent pay increase

   [55]• Which Premier League club has the most expensive matchday
   tickets?

   The agents who took £129.9m in fees from the Premier League last
   season, without a single club identifying who they are or which Cayman
   Islands account they might be relocating it. They bury their heads,
   too.

   We can’t shine the light too much on the agents, can we?

   It might stop them dealing with your club again, and we can't ignore
   the fact they feed the transfer rumour mill that so obsesses us on
   deadline day. So we’ll all bury our heads at some point when demanding
   an extra £5 million is added to the bid for the star player we've set
   our heart on - as if it is loose change and unrelated to revenue
   streams.

   Those who say a £50,000-a-week salary increase to a star player is
   about ‘market forces’ and a club shows lack of ambition if they refuse
   to pay it. They’ll have to bury their heads,

   Managers, whose £7 million-a-year salaries are funded by the
   inflation-busting price increases that so alienate the supporters are
   told to bury their heads, prevented from addressing the issue in
   public. And what would they say? Would English football really be
   attracting Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola if it wasn’t the most
   appealing and profitable whore house in Europe?

   The TV broadcasters, stealthily increasing subscription charges since
   they bought English football in 1992, using this to subsidise their
   monstrous bids each time the hammer falls on the next Premier League
   auction. They bury their heads, sending their cameras to interview fan
   groups about how they’re being fleeced without a trace of irony. That
   next satellite TV increase is in the post, boys and girls.

   The Grim Reaper at Anfield

   On the wheel spins - a cycle of cynical complicity - as the
   premonitions of English football’s bubble bursting are annually
   dismissed as little more than misguided prophecies of doom because we
   pay. We all pay, and if we don’t someone else in the Far East or
   emerging football market will.

   And then [57]Liverpool fans unfurl a banner saying ‘Enough is Enough’
   and walk out of the game. With their recent experience of orchestrated
   protest and a social media savvy that must make every Premier League PR
   team blush, they enact stage one of their mobilisation process and it
   works. My does it work, as 10,000 vacated their seats in the 77th
   minute of the home fixture with Sunderland.

   Another 30,000 stayed but don’t presume they were supporting the new
   ticket prices. They just wanted to watch the game they’d paid for,
   although given what they witnessed from their side in the last 13
   minutes they must wish they didn’t.

   Supporters unveil a banner saying 'Enough is Enough'

   Those departing are decent fans rather than revolutionaries, many of
   whom know their ticket will be the same price next season, but are
   considering future ramifications and generations. Now matter how much
   they’re told the number of cheaper seats in one area might outnumber
   the most expensive, their trust in Premier League accountancy
   extinguished 20 years ago.

   The board members at other clubs were probably watching the images and
   praying this was a one off, a regional eccentricity in a city where
   football and meaningful political expressions have often walked side by
   side.

   They will find they're wrong. When they’ve stopped burying their heads
   they will have to compromise. Otherwise, they’ll be left to do little
   more than hang them. In shame.

   Liverpool drew 2-2 with Sunderland on Saturday. Two-nil up they
   conceded two stupid goals.

   You might think this match report is not about the game. Read it again.
   Every word of it is.
