WATCH: Cam Newton abruptly leaves Super Bowl 50 postgame interview

   By Will Brinson | NFL Writer

   SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- A sullen [86]Cam Newton was not remotely
   interested in speaking with the media after the [87]Panthers lost
   [88]Super Bowl 50 and abruptly left the podium in the middle of his
   media session.

   Newton spent two-and-a-half minutes answering questions and basically
   pouting before standing up and leaving.

     "I don't know what you want me to say, I'm sorry." - A dejected Cam
     Newton walks off the podium abruptly. [89]#SB50
     [90]https://t.co/xw4iLd1CQz
     — NFL (@NFL) [91]February 8, 2016

   In fairness to Cam, you could hear the Broncos celebrating loudly over
   a thin barrier. But he's not doing himself any favors with the way he
   handled an admittedly difficult time. Here's audio of Broncos
   cornerback Chris Harris apparently talking loudly right behind Cam.

     THIS is why Cam walked out (listen to what's being said in the
     background). [92]pic.twitter.com/6LdLFwv8tj
     — Brian (@bmweezy13) [93]February 8, 2016

   Regardless of the distraction, Cam's answers consisted of mostly
   one-word responses like "no" and a discussion about being outplayed.

     No.

     We got outplayed.

     We got outplayed, bro.

     We lost.

     No.

     They just played better than us. I don't know what you want me to
     say. They made more plays than us and that's what it comes down to.
     We had our opportunities. We dropped balls, we turned the ball over,
     gave up sacks, errant passes. That's it. They scored more points
     than us.

     No.

     No.

   He's not required to answer questions with the media and it shouldn't
   be a hot-take war on Newton because of his responses. But he's probably
   going to get blasted for something he could've avoided.

   Cam Newton didn't have the best Sunday. (USATSI) Cam Newton didn't have
   the best Sunday. (USATSI)
