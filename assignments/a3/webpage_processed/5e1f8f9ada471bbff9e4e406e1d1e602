      SAN JOSE -- North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory escaped injury after the
      vehicle he was riding in was rear-ended on Highway 237 less than an
      hour after Super Bowl 50 let out at nearby Levi's Stadium, authorities
      said.

      The collision was reported at 8:05 p.m. in the eastbound lanes east of
      the North First Street exit, according to the California Highway
      Patrol. Officer Ross Lee said McCrory's Ford was hit from behind by a
      Mercedes. The Ford then ran into the back of a Fiat.

      Lee described the collision as minor, and that while McCrory -- who was
      not driving -- complained of pain, he was not taken to hospital. A
      passenger was taken to the hospital for a precautionary evaluation.
      None of the other motorists involved was seriously injured.

      McCrory, 59, was soon put into another vehicle and "continued on to his
      destination," Lee said.

      McCrory attended Super Bowl 50 and about 40 minutes before the
      collision, he tweeted, "We are so proud of our Carolina @Panthers for
      an amazing year. Showed the USA what NC is made of. We will
      #keeppounding" in reference to the Carolina Panthers' 24-10 loss to the
      Denver Broncos.
