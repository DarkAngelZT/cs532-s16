Cam Newton walked out of post-game interview after Super Bowl loss

   Cam Newton walks out of press conference

   Cam Newton walked out of his post-game press conference after the
   Panthers’ 24–10 Super Bowl loss to the Broncos.

   Posted: Sun Feb. 7, 2016 Updated: Mon Feb. 8, 2016

   Panthers quarterback Cam Newton walked out of his post-game interview
   after the Panthers’ 24–10 Super Bowl loss to the Broncos.

   Before abruptly standing up and walking away from the podium, Newton
   dodged reporters’ questions, saying nothing was memorable about the
   game. He offered only short answers to questions, repeating that
   Carolina was simply outplayed.

   “They just played better than us. I don’t know what you want me to say.
   They made better plays than us, and that’s what it came down to. We had
   our opportunities, it wasn’t anything special that we did.”

   Just before he walked away, Newton seemed to get upset after
   overhearing a Broncos player doing interview.

     THIS is why Cam walked out (listen to what's being said in the
     background). [240]pic.twitter.com/6LdLFwv8tj
     — Brian (@bmweezy13) [241]February 8, 2016

   [242]According to Ian Rapoport of NFL.com, Broncos cornerback Chris
   Harris Jr. could be heard saying that the game plan was to force Newton
   to throw the ball.

   Newton struggled in the game against Denver’s intimidating pass rush.
   He was sacked six times, fumbled twice and threw an interception. He
   finished completing 18 of 41 passes for 265 yards with no touchdowns,
   and ran six times for 45 yards.

   The Panthers went 15–1 in the regular season, and Sunday marked just
   their second loss of a dominant overall campaign.

   Newton was named the NFL’s 2015 MVP on Saturday.
