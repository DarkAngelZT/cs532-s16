Peyton Manning gets $2 million bonus for winning the Super Bowl

   Posted by Michael David Smith on February 7, 2016, 11:01 PM EST
   SANTA CLARA, CA - FEBRUARY 07: Peyton Manning #18 of the Denver Broncos
   celebrates with the Vince Lombardi Trophy after Super Bowl 50 at Levi's
   Stadium on February 7, 2016 in Santa Clara, California. The Broncos
   defeated the Panthers 24-10. (Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images)

   As it turned out, [76]Peyton Manning didn‚Äôt take a pay cut this season.

   Although the Broncos got Manning to agree to reduce his base salary for
   the 2015 season from $19 million to $15 million, Manning got the
   Broncos to include two significant bonuses: $2 million for reaching the
   Super Bowl, and $2 million for winning the Super Bowl.

   Manning earned the first bonus two weeks ago and the second bonus
   tonight, and as a result he still gets paid $19 million for the 2015
   season.

   The 2016 season is the final year on the five-year contract Manning
   signed with the Broncos as a free agent in 2012. Manning is due $19
   million for 2016, although it‚Äôs unlikely that he will see any of that
   money, as Manning is expected to retire.

       But, but, but, but packer fans were saying they are going to win
       the super bowl this year!
    2. [89]alan226 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:05 PM
       What a great performance for a 2 million dollar bonus‚Ä¶.
    3. intrafinesse says: Feb 7, 2016 11:06 PM
       I guess the Broncos are satisfied with the result üòâ
    4. [90]ibelievebrady says: Feb 7, 2016 11:07 PM
       That will be going to Charlie Sly. There is a reason back in Dec
       Charlie wouldn‚Äôt talk to OTL until he had permission from Peyton‚Äôs
       attorneys.
    5. intrafinesse says: Feb 7, 2016 11:07 PM
       Peyton needs to retire, just ride off into the sunset.
       Kind of nice to see Cam exposed as a non-leader.
       He was rattled and looked miffed.
       He needs to mature more to be a super star when it maters.
    6. [91]theseekeroffun says: Feb 7, 2016 11:07 PM
       A big congratulations to D. Ware!
       A long time Cowboys fan!
    7. tim2200 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:07 PM
       Should take the 2 mill and divide it up among the D-line.
       Peyton did nothing to win the Super Bowl.
       In fact he was the reason the game remained fairly close.
    8. [92]sackdance says: Feb 7, 2016 11:09 PM
       All season long, talking smack with so many fans from every

       No wonder he was so emotional
   10. joewilliesshnoz says: Feb 7, 2016 11:16 PM
       You bet he does !
   11. jimbo75025 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:18 PM
       Cams post game conference was almost marshawn lynch style.
       Easy to dab and act a fool until you get hit in the mouth I guess.
   12. [93]bills99 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:21 PM
       Congratulations Peyton.
       Cam, keep show boating.
       Go Bills!
   13. [94]imodan says: Feb 7, 2016 11:22 PM
       I wonder how Papa John got down on the field so fast? I know it‚Äôs
       coming, just wait. ‚ÄúPeyton Manning, you just won the Super Bowl.
       What are you going to do?! I‚Äôm going to Papa Johns!‚Äù
   14. wkheathjr says: Feb 7, 2016 11:24 PM
       Dont You Dare To Write A Movie Script About Peyton Manning Winning
       The Super Bowl 50 And Rode Off The Sunset! He sucked as bad as Cam
       Newton but way worse! I‚Äôm just glad he is able to feel better at
       Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner not having to hear from his
       little brother he only have one ring. Now he have two just like his
       younger brother.. It would be wise to retire and that is a great
       way to go out knowing the last game you won was at the Super Bowl.
   15. bassplucker says: Feb 7, 2016 11:24 PM
       Whew. For a minute there I was worried about his financial
       security.
   16. [95]terrier92 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:24 PM
       Congratulations Denver
       Your earned it . Enjoy it
       Pats fan here
   17. [96]truthfactory says: Feb 7, 2016 11:24 PM
       So according to fans‚Ä¶ When Tom Brady and Ben Rothlesburger win SB‚Äôs
       throwing for 140 yards and carried by defenses‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre still
       ‚Äúclutch‚Äù QB‚Äôs‚Ä¶ When Peyton Manning does it, he‚Äôs a bum.
       TEAMS win championships. It‚Äôs proven every year. This year, Peyton
       was carried by a great team. Seems fitting as for most of his
       career he was carrying bad teams to the playoffs. Bout time the
       favor was returned.
       Manning:
       4 Superbowls appearances
       2 Championships
       Winning playoff record
       3-2 vs Brady in Playoffs (3-1 in AFC Championship games)
       Owns almost all QB passing records
       Heck of a career‚Ä¶ Congrats to #18
   18. [97]fineswisswatches says: Feb 7, 2016 11:28 PM
       Interesting what a team can do with a very good physical defense, a
       decent running attack and a old average at best QB!

       Interesting what a team can do with a very good physical defense, a
       decent running attack and a old average at best QB! The Patriots
       could learn a thing or two from that,
   20. syrinx35 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:33 PM
       Of course Peyton is no longer in his prime and this game was won by
       the defense, but it was still cool to see him win.
       And it was even better to see Cam lose‚Ä¶.
   21. [99]magnumpimustache says: Feb 7, 2016 11:33 PM
       The best team won. Congratulations enjoy it.
       ‚Äì Pats nation
   22. drewzducks says: Feb 7, 2016 11:36 PM
       Just think how many more leg breakers he can hire to harass and
       intimidate Sly and the Family Stone.
   23. [100]sportsguy3434 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:39 PM
       So how much did he get for the Budwiser endorsements for the
       interviews?
   24. [101]rgorr44 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:44 PM
       The 2 mill really should h be divided up and given to that Defense.
       Can‚Äôt win a superbowl without a really good D and the Broncos
       definitely have that.

       ‚â†‚â†=================================
       This was a season you are going to cherish forever? Really? That‚Äôs
       really sad right there.
   26. [103]jordiway73 says: Feb 8, 2016 12:28 AM
       How much did he get for saying Budwiser?
   27. [104]cross300 says: Feb 8, 2016 5:43 AM
       The easiest 2 million ever earned. He did nothing all game.
   28. jjackwagon says: Feb 8, 2016 9:14 AM
       Proof that game managers can win the SB when they have a good
       defense.
