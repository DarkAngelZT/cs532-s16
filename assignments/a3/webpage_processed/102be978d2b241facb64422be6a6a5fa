   Marvel/Universal/Disney

   Unless you were a Denver Broncos fan, Peyton Manning or, like, [83]Papa
   John, the [84]Super Bowl was kind of rough on Sunday.

   Thank gosh some new movie commercials and trailers, like a first look
   at "[85]Jason Bourne" and a new spot for "[86]Deadpool," saved the
   night. Because with new movies, everybody wins.

   Here are 8 movie trailers that were even better than the Super Bowl:

   1. "Jason Bourne"

   Matt Damon returns because he was Bourne this way. (Release date: July
   29.)


   2. "Captain America: Civil War"

   Iron Man almost gets shot in the face, [87]Captain America has claw
   marks on his shield and the Internet's [88]spidey senses are tingling.
   (Release date: May 6.)


   3. "The Jungle Book"

   Mowgli really wants to learn the bear necessities, but Shere Khan won't
   let him forget about his worries or his strife. (Release date: April
   15.)


   4. "Independence Day: Resurgence"

   Bill Pullman will not go quietly into the night or give up without a
   fight. The aliens have different plans. (Release date: June 24.)


   5. "X-Men: Apocalypse"

   It's the end of the world and only [89]Jennifer Lawrence can save us.
   What else is new? (Release date: May 27.)


   6. "Eddie the Eagle"

   An Olympic story almost as inspirational as "Cool Runnings." Almost ...

   (Release date: Feb 26.)


   7. "The Secret Life of Pets"

    Pets apparently listen to the stereo while you're away. (Release date:
   July 8.)


   8. "Deadpool"

   "See you this Friday, America." (Release date: Feb. 12.)
