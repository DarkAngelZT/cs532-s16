   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- T.J. McConnell channeled his inner [97]Ish Smith.

   McConnell, filling in for injured starting point guard Ish Smith, tied
   his career-high with 17 points to help the [98]Philadelphia 76ers down
   the [99]Brooklyn Nets 103-98 on Saturday night.

   [100]Jahlil Okafor had 22 points and 17 rebounds and [101]Nerlens Noel
   added 18 points, including a key dunk late in the fourth quarter, for
   Philadelphia.

   McConnell, a rookie, was a huge reason why the 76ers were able to earn
   their eighth win while snapping a four-game losing streak.

   ''He was inspirational,'' Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said.

   McConnell credited Smith, who injured his ankle while scoring 22 points
   in Philadelphia's 106-94 loss at Washington Friday night.

   ''I was just trying to do my best impression of him tonight,''
   McConnell said.

   Although they improved to just 8-43, the 76ers have been improved since
   acquiring Smith in late December from New Orleans, going 6-13 with him
   in the lineup.

   ''From the moment he got here, I think our team played for the
   better,'' McConnell said. ''Even while Ish was on the bench, he was
   showing leadership.''

   [102]Thaddeus Young scored all 22 of his points after halftime for
   Brooklyn, which was trying to win consecutive games for the first time
   since Dec. 10. Young added 10 rebounds and [103]Brook Lopez had 17
   points for the Nets.

   The Nets trailed by as many as 15 points in the first half and were
   down 69-64 entering the fourth quarter. [104]Markel Brown's third
   3-pointer of the contest with 6:59 remaining gave Brooklyn its biggest
   lead, 86-81. But the 76ers scored eight of the next 10 and went back up
   on [105]Hollis Thompson's 3 from the left wing that made it 89-88 with
   4:44 left. Philadelphia's lead was still one point once when
   [106]Robert Covington drained a 3-pointer with 1:16 to play that made
   it 97-96. Both teams missed field goals on ensuing possessions before
   McConnell's steal with 30 seconds left led to Noel's dunk with 21.3
   ticks remaining that made it 99-96 and was enough for Philadelphia to
   earn their seventh win in the last 20 games.

   Brooklyn dropped to 4-19 on the road.

   ''When you get consistent how you play, then we'll start turning these
   games into wins,'' Nets interim coach Tony Brown said. ''I commend them
   for getting back in it, but obviously there's still a lot of work we
   have to do.''

   MARKEL'S NIGHT

   Markel Brown, who entered averaging just 2.5 per game, was perfect from
   the field while setting a season-high with 15 points for the Nets.
   Brown made all five of his shots, including three 3-pointers.

   ''He was very decisive,'' Tony Brown said. ''It was good to see that.
   He saw shots and took them, and the ball was falling for him.''

   Markel Brown, known as a defensive specialist, said he's been working
   hard on his jump shot.

   ''I'm trying to elevate my game to not be one-dimensional,'' he said.

   NOT SAME NETS

   The Nets set a season-high for points in Friday's 128-119 home win over
   the Kings, but they mustered just 12 points while sleepwalking through
   the first quarter. Brooklyn turned the ball over 11 times and missed 12
   of 17 shots while falling behind 24-12 after one.

   ''That hurt us and that triggered down through the whole game,'' said
   [107]Joe Johnson, who had nine points. ''We never got in sync.''

   Philadelphia's lead grew to as many as 15 points early in the second
   quarter before the Nets responded with 27 of the final 37 points of the
   quarter to enter halftime down 41-39.

   After setting a season-high with 18 3-pointers against Sacramento on
   Friday, the Nets went 5-for-15 from the arc against Philadelphia.

   TIP-INS

   Nets: Tony Brown said prior to the game that there is no firm date set
   yet for the debut of [108]Chris McCullough. The rookie was active for
   the second straight game on Saturday and could play as early as Monday
   at home against the Nuggets. ... The loss snapped Brooklyn's three-game
   road winning streak against the 76ers. . The last time the Nets had a
   winning streak was Dec. 8 and Dec. 10 when they defeated Houston and
   the 76ers, respectively.

   76ers: Philadelphia honored the late Darryl Dawkins with video
   tributes, a halftime interview with former teammates World B. Free and
   Bobby Jones and posters to the first 15,000 fans. Dawkins played the
   first seven seasons of his 14-year career with the 76ers, who drafted
   him fifth in 1975. ... F [109]Richaun Holmes (sprained right ankle)
   missed his second straight game. ... The 76ers had three three-second
   violations.
