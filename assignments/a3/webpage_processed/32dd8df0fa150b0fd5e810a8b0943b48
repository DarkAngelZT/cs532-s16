About this project

   - Si quieres ver la campaña en Español, dirígete [72]¡AQUÍ!

   What will happen if you could make your childhood (or not that
   childish) dream come true?

   You will become a Superhero!
   Join the team Join the team

   With this in mind and our inspiration coming from video games like
   XCOM, Massive Chalice, Might and Magic and The Banner Saga plus all the
   Superhero comics and movies that we grew with, there was only one video
   game that we could make: a Superhero turn-based strategy and management
   game.

   We are in the earliest stage of the development so, we think this is
   the best time to get you on board! We need to know if you want this
   game to be true by sharing your feedback with us and supporting Human
   Heroes on Kickstarter.

   position of a Superheroes Director in his/her own Agency.

   battles where you can fight alongside your heroes and, base management,
   where you can customize, research, build and run the Agency as you
   consider.

   In Human Heroes permadeath applies to every character. In case that
   your colleagues die, they will be lost forever but you will continue
   the story with those deaths on your shoulders but… when you die, you
   will not be able to continue and your game will end!

       human being having a transformation that changes his/her life.

   Early Tech Lab concept Early Tech Lab concept

   We are quite new in game development but we are eager to get experience
   and make our dreamed games. Human Heroes is our first title and we are
   pretty ambitious with it, we really believe that we can do it with your
   help. We are afraid of nothing and we want to get as much knowledge as
   we can to improve!

   Because we need to know if you want this game, that proof will tell us
   if we think as you do and give us wings to continue doing it. Also, we
   need the fundings to put all our team in a full-time work basis and
   quit their part-time jobs.
   We feel your support! We feel your support!

   We are a new studio so we don’t have enough money to complete the game
   alone and Kickstarter is the best option for us to keep our creativity
   and ideas free. We believe in our project and in our team, we need that
   little push that Kickstarter provides.

   To complete Human Heroes we need 85.000 € and we will use it this way
   to make our dream come true:

   Also, we want to tell you how much time we think it will cost us to
   complete this project to have it ready for launching.

Risks and challenges

   We are really aware that we are not a studio with history, we are
   “newcomers” and this is our first project. That we don’t have the trust
   of the people because nobody knows us is a risk but it is also a
   challenge, we know that we can work a name from 0 and return to you all
   the trust that you give to us.

   There is always the possibility of not acquiring the amount of money
   that we ask in Kickstarter and we want to let you know that we will
   find the way to make Human Heroes possible.

   Part of the team has already participated in other video games project
   and now, as a team, we want to finish our first game and learn
   everything we can by doing it. If it is a failure, we will learn so
   many ways of how it can’t be done!
