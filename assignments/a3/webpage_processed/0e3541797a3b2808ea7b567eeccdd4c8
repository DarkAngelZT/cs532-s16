OLYMPIC SPORTS

   August 7, 2012 by [86]Crystal McClean [87]1 Comment

   [DEL: :DEL] We’ve been watching some of the Olympic events over the
   past week.  It makes a change from the ordinary as we don’t usually
   have the TV on during the day unless it’s been a particularly tiring
   day or someone isn’t well.  Yesterday we were watching a little cycling
   and Tristan was able to tell me how Canada was doing by seeing the
   Canadian flag come up with the place number beside it.  It was a long
   race, and by the end both children were hollering at the TV.  Kallista
   saying “Go Can, Can!” and Tristan “Go Candada!!  You can do it!”.  It
   was so cute!

   [DEL: 3 DIY Olympic Sports for Children :DEL]

   I saw an archery set at one of the £ stores a while back, but thought
   twice about it as I don’t want the children to become aggressive with
   that type of toy around.  But while in Belfast on Monday unexpectedly,
   I decided to buy it as we could use it for several things in learning
   about hunting/gathering societies, hand/eye coordination, and the
   Olympics.  PSNI, archery, hand-eye cooridination, Whitehead food and
   folk festival 2012, photo

   We were at the local Food and Folk Fest last week and stopped by to see
   what was going on and watched PSNI Michael try his hand at archery.  He
   could use a little practice…but he became better with each shot.  I
   gave it a go as well, but let’s just say I’m not as good as I was at
   the age of 13 when I could beat every boy in my class….Tristan on the
   other hand is getting the hang of it

   hand-eye coordination, photo

   The children have seen Phil recently doing some exercises and yoga in
   the mornings before he heads off to work, and during the day they try
   to imitate him by putting their feet under the sofa and trying some
   sit-ups, or striking a yoga pose if the mat is still out.  So we
   thought we’d add to their repertoire.

   I made a prop for Kallista by using some double-sided tape to secure a
   pre-loved ribbon onto a chopstick.

   Then we let her loose!  rhythmic gymnastics, London Olympics and kids
   sport, photo

   Next Phil put some water into some used and clean tiny milk bottles
   previously purchased for use with the play kitchen.  These then became
   Tristan’s weights.  He was moving them about in such a way that I
   didn’t think there was anything in them.  Next time we’ll have to find
   larger bottles or try some sand!

   and water, photo

   This next feat, Kallista did all on her own in the kitchen a few days
   ago and gave me the idea for this post.

   Tristan added some squats to the routine.

   So the next time the weather isn’t favourable to going out and the
   children need to burn off some steam, just search around the kitchen
   for some odd bits to turn your home into a gym!

       This is why the Olympics are wonderful, the encourage so much
       imitation and physical activity, getting kids and parents more
       active. These are great things for your children to learn and
       practice, and will help in academic areas as well. Thanks so much
       for writing. I was thinking about you being so close to where the
       action was! Carolyn
