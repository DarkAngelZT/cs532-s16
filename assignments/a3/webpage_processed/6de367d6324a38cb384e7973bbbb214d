Movie Day: 3 Ways for ELLs to Get the Most Out of Films

   Posted on [51]4 February 2016 by [52]Nathan Hall

   Anyone who grew up in the American school system has memories of
   watching movies in class. Maybe the teacher wanted you to see a
   different historic period or understand a play or novel the class was
   reading a little better, but either way it was probably a passive
   experience where someone else talked and you listened until class
   ended.

   For an English language learner, though, this can be much more
   frustrating. Unfamiliar words will come and go so fast they won’t get a
   chance to build up enough context to understand the story. This may
   also be their first exposure to the movie’s setting, so they may get
   too distracted by the costumes and scenery to pay attention to the
   language. And, perhaps worst of all, the passivity of watching a screen
   doesn’t give students the practice they need to learn the language.

   To get the most out of movies, we need to make it an activity. Here are
   some ways for your students to get the most out of their viewing
   experience.

   1. Cut to the good parts. Think about why you want to show the movie,
   and then decide what parts are the most important. For example, if
   you’re going to show a (presumably PG version of) Glory to show what
   the Civil War was like, cut to the battle chapters on the DVD. You can
   use the time spent going through the menu to reinforce what you want
   the students to look for (“How do the people on the deck of the Titanic
   dress different from Jack and his friends?”) and also cut through the
   scenes students may find objectionable.

   2. Give students something to write while they watch. Your students may
   be attuned to your teacher talk, so this is a good chance to stretch
   their listening capabilities. You can give them a worksheet with
   relevant vocabulary words so they can write out the definition based on
   the context (“How did the land look during the drought?”), have them
   observe relevant details (“What colors were the uniforms?”), or just
   take notes on how a scene made them feel and why.

   3. Thumbs up or down? Let the students know they’ll have to write or
   orally present a quick review of what they saw. They can say whether
   they liked it or didn’t as a matter of their opinion as long as they
   present reasons for what they think and felt—and, in my experience, it
   helps to have a minimum of reasons (two would be good for lower-level
   students and more proficient ones can handle four or five). You may
   want to model how to take notes during a movie before and during the
   clip to get students into the habit of jotting down relevant
   information. As long as students can support their opinions with
   relevant information, you’ve done something to help their
   communication.

   While clips are a great supplement for content-based instruction
   because of the visual elements, I still try to make movie days more of
   a treat than a regular thing. I’d rather not be known as the teacher
   whose class is a film-fest. Still, films may be a good choice during
   weeks that are abbreviated or interrupted by holidays or breaks,
   because it’s hard to maintain momentum when you can’t have regular
   classes.

   How do you use films with your students?

       These are some good tips. When I show videos, which isn’t too
       often, I try to find videos that have captioning so they can hear
       and see the words. I also sometimes have them write down unfamiliar
       words that we can discuss later. It can also help if you have time
       to watch videos in chunks, and pause to ask comprehension questions
       as you go along.
