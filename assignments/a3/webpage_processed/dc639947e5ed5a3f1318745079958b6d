   super-bowl-2016-1920
   On February 7, two NFL teams will take the field to battle it out on
   the most-watched sports night of the year, but marketers know where the
   real competition is happening: the Super Bowl Ads!

   Super Bowl is a whole lot more than football; it is the ultimate
   advertising arena. This year, a select number of brands are spending
   upwards of $5 million to reserve their spot during the game — making a
   play to win the minds and hearts (and laughs) of the biggest ad
   audience available.

   To prepare for game day, Marketing Land is keeping its own scorecard of
   which brands are competing and what they’re planning for game day.

   We’ll continue to update this list as more information is made
   available from the advertisers and more ads are released.

   You can easily follow all of these brands via [67]Marketing Land’s
   Twitter list of Super Bowl 50 advertisers. Also, be sure to check out
   our 2016 HashtagBowl, where we track pre-game and post-game social
   media visibility for this year’s Super Bowl TV commercials: [68]Game
