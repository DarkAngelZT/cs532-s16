18 Indoor workouts to try this winter

   18 Indoor workouts to try this winter
   [INS: :INS]

   It's winter - it's dark when your alarm goes off, dark when you get
   home from work and it's pretty cold out there! So it's no wonder your
   motivation to get outside and work up a sweat was last seen during
   warmer days. Don't let the [29]cold weather give you reason to skip
   your workouts and risk failing to meet your[30] health and fitness
   goals. We've rounded up some of our favourite indoor workouts that you
   have to try this winter - no excuses!

#1. Ice, Ice, Baby

   Ice skating isn't just for the kids - your local indoor rink is the
   perfect place for a workout and it's fun too! Ice skating burns around
   500 calories an hour, whilst toning your [31]butt, legs and core and
   boosting balance and co-ordination too [32](1)!

#2. Reach great heights

   Indoor[33] rock climbing is not only fun, it's a great cardio workout
   and works your brain too! Burn up to 650 calories an hour, increase
   your heart rate, work your arm muscles and tone your shoulders, legs
   and back [34](2).

#3. Get spinning

   Freezing your butt off on a winter bike ride might not sound appealing,
   so why not head for[35] spin class? It's an intense workout that can
   burn hundreds of calories and strengthen your bones. Your butt, thighs
   and core get a workout without the need to wear a helmet!

#4. Workout on a budget

   Save time and money (on [36]gym membership) and stay warm with[37]
   bodyweight exercises which use your body resistance to boost endurance
   and strength - no equipment needed.

#5. Kick some butt!

   A [38]boxing class is a full-body workout - you'll be ducking, blocking
   and throwing punches like a pro in no time. Boxing moves focus on
   cardio and conditioning, so you'll tone up rather than bulk up!

#6. Chill out

   [39]Yoga is a great mind and body workout which can help [40]relieve
   stress, anxiety and fatigue, as well as improving strength and
   flexibility [41](3).

#7. Reach for the sky

   Your inner kid is going to love[42] trampolining - it's the latest
   fitness craze. Just 6 minutes of cardio moves on a trampoline is the
   equivalent of running about a mile! It's low-impact too, protecting
   your joints.

#8. Be a swinger

   Not that kind of swinger - the [43]kettlebell kind! Combine strength
   and cardio training in one workout - a 20 minute session could see you
   burning up to 20 calories per minute!

#9. Row for victory

   Those men hogging the rowers at the gym know something you don't -
   rowing is a great full-body workout, increasing your heart rate and
   getting[44] endorphins flowing. An hour of intense rowing could burn up
   to 1,200 calories.

#10. Tone your core

   Core strength is key to being fitter and healthier.[45] Pilates is a
   form of strength training which increases flexibility and defines your
   core. Pilates moves can be modified to suit your fitness level and
   they're great fun!

#11. Take some time out

   [46]Tai Chi is a low-impact form of exercise which originated in China.
   It combines deep breathing techniques with slow motions and martial
   arts moves to help balance yin and yang. Tai Chi can also help improve
   balance,[47] reduce stress levels and improve your cardiovascular
   health [48](4).

#12. Get a ballet dancer's body

   [49]Ballet barre workouts combine elements of Pilates, yoga and weight
   training to tone and elongate muscles. Ideal for men and women, you'll
   find barre workouts are surprisingly challenging!

#13. Make a splash

   Squeeze in a few laps at your local pool or gym this winter -
   [50]swimming is a low-impact, full-body workout which can improve your
   breathing technique and boost your mood whilst giving you a leaner
   physique [51](5).

#14. Drop and give us 20

   [52]Boot camp workouts are a great way to reach your fitness goals and
   although many take place outdoors at local parks. some may move indoors
   during the winter months! Most will let you try a trial session for
   free before you commit.

#15. Up the intensity

   Plyometrics is a great way to get an intense full-body workout. Plyo
   moves such as jumping jacks, single-leg hops and tuck jumps all boost
   strength and cardio endurance. Check out some of our [53]plyo moves!

#16. Shoot some hoops

   Basketball isn't just for the summer months - a game of indoor
   basketball can burn over 600 calories an hour! Running on court
   improves your athletic endurance and you'll boost your co-ordination
   and balance too.

#17. Defend yourself

   A combo of self-defense, boxing and martial arts moves, kickboxing
   classes can reduce stress, burn fat, [54]tone your core and increase
   flexibility. And you can expect to burn around 750 calories an hour
   [55](6)!

#18. Defy gravity

   [56]TRX workouts are awesome - the system is popular with Navy SEALs,
   and this suspension trainer works your whole body, including your core.
   No matter what your fitness level, the exercises can be modified to
   suit your abilities, so investing in a TRX suspension kit this winter
   is a good move - or check to see if your local gym holds classes.
