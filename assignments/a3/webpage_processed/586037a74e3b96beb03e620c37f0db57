   There was a lot of excitement on senior night at Providence Day Friday
   night, and that excitement translated into a girls and boys basketball
   sweep of the Country Day Buccaneers.

   In the boys game the Chargers, ranked No. 1 in the Observer’s Sweet 16,
   dominated from start to finish in a 78-56 victory. Country Day had one
   lead as they scored the first basket of the game. From then on out it
   was all Providence Day.

   The win also gave Providence Day its fourth consecutive outright CISAA
   conference championship. Senior big men, Josh Howard and Isaac Johnson,
   led the way for the Chargers as both were dominant underneath and on
   the fast break. Howard finished with 17 points while Johnson poured in
   16 points. Sophomore Trey Wertz also added 14 for Providence Day that
   included four 3-pointers.

   “It was my last game at this place so I just gave it my all and gave a
   show for the fans.” said Johnson. “We took every practice and every
   game serious so we just play hard. We love the game and we love PD.”

   Another senior, Scott Peterson, doesn’t start but is the Chargers’
   first man off the bench. Peterson had nine points (on three 3-pointers)
   and talked about playing his last game on his home floor. “Definitely
   exciting especially with our student section,” he said. “It’s always
   good to see those guys come out here. Our season isn’t over and we’re
   going for the state championship. It’s a big night for all of us.”

   The Chargers have two more regular-season games remaining, and then the
   playoffs. Coach Brian Field says there are still some things to work on
   before the post season. “We want to compete, play our hardest and just
   like every day we want to attack and be our best,” said Field. “We also
   want to fine tune a few things so we are playing our best basketball
   heading on to Raleigh (for the state playoffs).”

   In the girls game Providence Day, No. 2 in the Sweet 16, won 63-9 in a
   wire-to-wire victory over Country Day. The Chargers win also gave them
   at least a share of the CISAA conference title.

THREE WHO MATTERED

   Isaac Johnson: Chargers senior forward had 16 points, seven rebounds,
   five assists, and shot

   73% from the floor.

   Erin Whalen: Providence Day girls star had 23 points. She’s signed to
   Vanderbilt.

   Jack Vaughn: Buccaneers senior forward led Country Day with 14 points,
   and was one of only two Bucs’ players to finish in double figures.
   (Triston Miller was the other with ten points)

THEY SAID IT

   “It was a fun night. Every player on our team scored tonight which
   whether they admit it or not, all kids like to do. It was nice to see
   everyone get in the box score.” Providence

   Day girls coach Josh Springer.

RECORDS

   Country Day girls (7-14, 1-7), Country Day boys (10-17, 2-6)

   Providence Day girls (22-2, 8-0), Providence Day boys (25-3, 8-0)

WHAT’S NEXT
