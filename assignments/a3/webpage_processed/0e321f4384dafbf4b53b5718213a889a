   11 Ways to Get your Kids Moving This Winter

   Are your kids going stir crazy this winter? I know that my kids often
   get stir crazy especially on days when we are snowed in or it’s too
   cold to go outside. Most kids don’t get nearly enough exercise during
   the day. Today, I wanted to share with you 11 ways to get your kids
   moving this winter and help keep them from bouncing off the walls.

   Disclosure: This post may contain affiliate links.

Roller Skating

   Head to your local roller skating rink and let your children burn off a
   ton of energy. Not only is roller skating fun but it is a full body
   workout. If your children haven’t been roller skating, most rinks are
   prepared for beginners and can help your child learn how to roller
   skate. Some children prefer to use roller blades instead of traditional
   roller skates.

Ice Skating

   I have always wanted to learn how to ice skate but I grew up in a town
   that didn’t have any ice skating rinks. Ice skating is also a ton of
   fun and kids can have fun while exercising. Most ice skating rinks are
   also prepared for beginners and have tools to assist your child in
   learning how to ice skate.

Ride their Bicycle

   Children Can Ride Bicycle During the winter to Stay Active

   If the weather is nice outside, you can send them outside to ride their
   bicycle. Make sure that you bundle them up if it is chilly outside.
   Also, make sure that they are wearing a helmet too.

Video Games That Encourage Movement

   There are a bunch of fun video games on the market for the X-Box 360
   and Wii U. Find several games that your child enjoys and let them burn
   off some energy while they are busy playing video games.

Jump Rope

   Your child will probably frown when you hand them a jump rope. However,
   if you can get them to use it, it is a wonderful way to get them to
   burn off some of their excess energy. Just make sure that your child
   has plenty of room around them to safely jump rope. Also, they need to
   use it on a flat surface so that they don’t accidentally injure
   themselves.

Play Games

   Kids usually enjoy playing games and don’t realize that are exercising.
   You can play games such as hop scotch, balloon volleyball, red light
   green light if you have enough room in your house, wheel barrow races,
   and animal races.

Dance

   Turn up the music and enjoy dancing to the tunes. You can even play
   free dance. Simply play the music for your children and have them dance
   until you pause the music. Then hit play again. They will have fun
   trying to figure out when you are going to pause the music and it gets
   them moving. Don’t be afraid to join in too.

Snowshoeing

   Do you have a ton of snow on the ground? Grab a pair of snowshoes and
   let your kids enjoy walking around the neighborhood. The snowshoes are
   fun and they keep your child from sinking into the deep snow. Plus, it
   burns more calories than walking alone and they probably won’t even
   notice that they are getting a great workout while outside playing.

Yoga

   Kids can enjoy the benefits of [26]yoga too. The great thing about yoga
   is you don’t need a ton of fancy equipment. Most kids are able to
   follow along to a video or you can use [27]Groker (an online resource
   that has a ton of yoga videos). You can even join them.

Clean Up

   Get your kids to have a race to help you get the house cleaned up. I
   know that they probably won’t enjoy cleaning but if you make it a game,
   they are more likely to participate.

Trampoline Park

   I have seen the trampoline parks popping up all over the place. It is a
   great place to allow your kids to burn off some excessive energy. Just
   a word of caution: if you have smaller kids, you might want to take
   them during off peak hours so that the older kids don’t trample them or
   you can find a trampoline park that has a section for younger kids.

   I have three kids so I know what it is like to be stuck inside of the
   house during the winter especially if there is snow and ice on the
   ground. I hope you enjoy these 11 ways to get your kids moving this
   winter helps keep them active and helps them expend some of their
   excessive energy.

Which of these 11 ways do you think that your kids would enjoy the most? Do
you try to keep your kids active in the winter? Do you have any other
suggestions to keep kids moving this winter?

       You have some awesome ideas listed to keep the kids moving during
       Winter ! I especially like that you specifically mention video

       I do not have kids yet but when I was a kid my mum used to play
       card games with us or traditional Zambian games when she was not
       working. These are some awesome ideas

       My youngest son loves music. For Christmas he got several of the
       dance games for the Wii. He’s been dancing up a storm ever since
       Christmas day.

       When I was a kid, my friends and I loved to roller skate. I have
       such fond memories of those days. My grands love to be outside on
       their bikes and it’s good exercise for them and me. Lots of fun,
       too!

       is fun too!

       The trampoline park is a fun go-to this time of year. I don’t keep
       up with them for long, but they are able to burn off some energy
       really effectively – maybe next week during their break.

       Mine would probably have fun at a trampoline park, but the nearest
       to us is about 45 minutes away. That’s a really great list of
       activities. Makes me think that we need to break out our Wii.

       Great tips. Roller skating, dancing and games will definitely do.

       These are all great activities for kids but my favorite is the
       racing with the cleaning. Here in the U. P. of Michigan we ski and
       go sledding which are both great activities to get the kids out of
       the house along with great exercise.

       much outside time as possible!

       These are such great ideas! It’s already hot here (it never really
       got cold, to be honest) so we’re already outside playing soccer and
       running around the park, but if it was cold, we’d be doing all of
       these!

       My kids get so bored in the winter so these are great tips that can
       help me children stay motivated. The trampoline park sounds like so
       much fun.
