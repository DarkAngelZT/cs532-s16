   The year 2015 wasn’t just about phenomenal performances and great
   films. It was a year that gave movie buffs multiple reasons to rejoice
   as conventional topics and done-to-death formulas took a backseat.
   While the eventful 2015 saw its share of disappointments, it did
   surprise many as successful films didn’t only stick to big production
   houses. There were several small budget and independent films which
   were impressive in their own niche ways. In the third edition of
   IBNLive Movie Awards, we select nominees in various popular categories
   and allow our readers decide the outcome. Take our poll to vote and
   choose Best Actor (South) of 2015.

   [37]IBNLive Movie Awards 2016: Nominees for Best Actor (South)

   Prabhas (Bahubali): Directed by SS Rajamouli, ‘Bahubali’ saw Prabhas
   essay a double role with effortless ease. As the free spirited Shiv he
   created a buzz courtesy his crackling chemistry with Tamannaah as well
   as his chiseled physique. Moreover, as Amrendra Bahubali the ‘Rebel
   Star’ carried off his royal look with breathtaking charm and struck up
   an electrifying onscreen rapport with Rana Daggubati.

   Mammooty (Pathemari): One of Malayalam cinema’s most celebrated names,
   Mammootty played a gulf immigrant in the period-drama ‘Pathemari’.
   Needless to say, the veteran National award winner underplayed his part
   to absolute perfection and brought to life the melancholy that was an
   integral part of the film’s narrative. Interestingly, ‘Pathemari’
   emerged a big winner at the box office.

   Kamal Haasan (Papanasam): Kamal Haasan gave strong proof of his
   abilities as an actor when he delivered a stellar performance in
   ‘Papanasam’. A remake of the Mohanlal starrer ‘Drishyam’, it featured
   the 61-year old in the role of an uneducated yet highly intelligent
   commoner. As expected, Haasan emerged the scene-stealer thanks to his
   powerful dialogue delivery and relatable mannerisms.

   Sudeep (Ranna): The popular Kannada superstar Sudeep continued his
   tryst with remakes, starring in the family-drama ‘Ranna’. Directed by
   Nanda Kishore, it was a remake of Pawan Kalyan’s ‘Attarintiki Daredi’.
   As usual, ‘Kiccha’ carried off the character with ease, adding
   emotional depth to it. Interestingly, ‘Ranna’ also featured Prakash Raj
   and Rachita Ram in pivotal roles.

   Ajith Kumar (Yennai Arindhaal): The Gautham Vasudev Menon-directed
   ‘Yennai Arindhaal' gave the ever the ever popular Ajith Kumar ample
   scope to showcase onscreen machismo to the fullest. Moreover, at the
   same time, it also featured some scenes which helped ‘Thala’ highlight
   his range as a performer. Released in February, ‘Yennai Arindhaal’ was
   a commercial success.

   Prithviraj (Ennu Ninte Moideen): Touted as a romantic-thriller, ‘Ennu
   Ninte Moideen’ saw Prithviraj play the role of a Muslim who falls in
   love with the daughter of a Hindu landlord. Not surprisingly, the
   talented actor delivered an intense performance, striking a crackling
   rapport with Parvathy.

   Ramesh and Vignesh (Kaaka Muttai): Arguably the biggest sleeper hit of
   the year, ‘Kaaka Muttai’ featured some extremely natural performances
   from child actors Ramesh and Vignesh. The two kids added new life to
   the narrative courtesy their lively screen presence and chemistry with
   onscreen mother Aishwarya Rajesh.

   Vikram (I): Shankar’s magnum opus ‘I’ was a true test of Vikram’s
   acting prowess. Essaying the role of a bodybuilder who gets disfigured
   courtesy a virus, the actor delivered a mature act and brought to life
   the trauma experienced by his character. Touted as a science
   fiction-thriller, ‘I’ emerged a winner at the box office.

   GV Prakash (Trisha Ileana Nayanthara): Music composer-turned-actor GV
   Prakash delivered a lively performance in the sex-comedy ‘Trisha Ileana
   Nayanthara’ and added a new dimension to his career. Featuring plenty
   of rib-tickling double meaning dialogues, it found tremendous critical
   success.

   Dulquer Salmaan (OK Kanmani): The resident lover boy of Southern cinema
   Dulquer Salmaan redefined the meaning of onscreen romance when he
   delivered an energentic performance in ‘OK Kanmani’. Moreover, the
   young actor also shared a natural and electrifying rapport with Nithya
   Menon. Interestingly, ‘OK Kanmani’ was helmed by celebrated filmmaker
   Mani Ratnam.
