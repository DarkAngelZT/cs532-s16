[96]Pittsburgh Steelers: Brandon Boykin To Return In 2016?

   [97]Pittsburgh Steelers: Brandon Boykin To Return In 2016?

   The Pittsburgh Steelers played Brandon Boykin only sparingly early in
   2015, but will he return to the defense he helped improve late in the
   season? Brandon Boykin may not be joining Antonio Brown on the field as
   a Steeler in 2016. (Photo : Getty Images) Brandon Boykin’s time with
   the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2015 probably didn’t go exactly how he
   planned. After the team acquired him from the Philadelphia Eagles late
   last preseason in exchange for a conditional pick, Boykin, a smaller
   cornerback who excelled at slot coverage during his time in Philly, but
   struggled to get any looks on the outside or, in other words, for a
   fulltime starting gig with the Eagles, was likely hopeful of showing
   what he could do and fighting for more playing time with the Steelers.
   Unfortunately, through the first 12 weeks of 2015, Boykin played even
   less in Pittsburgh than he’d gotten used to in Philadelphia. Now a
   pending unrestricted free agent, Boykin said recently that he’s open to
   a return to the Steelers.

   "At the end, the organization said they appreciated how I went about
   it, being a pro, not really talking about it," Boykin said, per ESPN’s
   Jeremy Fowler . "I don’t have any hard feelings toward Pittsburgh.
   Absolutely, under the right circumstances, for sure [I’d return]."

   Boykin finished last season with 25 tackles, 1 sack, 1 forced fumble, 1
   interception and 5 passes defensed. He played just 24.7 percent of the
   Steelers defensive snaps – not enough to turn the pick that went to
   Philly from a fifth-rounder to a fourth – and helped Pittsburgh over
   the last few weeks of the year turn themselves into one of the better
   defenses in the league.

   Unfortunately, the Steelers are looking at an offseason wherein Boykin
   is just one of five free agents in the secondary. There’s no denying
   Boykin’s talent – he collected 6 interceptions with the Eagles in 2013
   and played well when Pittsburgh coordinator Keith Butler gave him the
   chance – but the Steelers may now be the second franchise to give up on
   him. For as talented as he is, his size – 5-foot-10 – is probably a
   concern for most teams outside of Pittsburgh, a unit willing to play
   smaller guys like William Gay on the outside, and could keep him on the
   inside of whatever NFL defense he lands with.

[99]Sam Bradford or Chase Daniel? It’s not even close

   February 16, 2016
   [100]Sam Bradford or Chase Daniel? It's not even close

   PHILADELPHIA — Let’s start with the fact that we won’t necessarily know
   today whether the Philadelphia Eagles have decided to use the franchise
   tag on quarterback Sam Bradford . Teams are allowed to apply franchise
   or transition tags on players from this afternoon until March 1.

   The Eagles could apply the tag beginning at 4 p.m. If they decide to
   use it, they could still choose to wait until the deadline.

   ESPN’s Bill Barnwell, a certifiably smart guy, argued today that the
   Eagles should not tag Bradford. It was part of Barnwell’s list of five
   offseason suggestions for every NFC East team. I suggest reading his
   reasoning, but I will go ahead and continue the debate that
   unofficially began when I recommended using the tag .

   Barnwell’s point that the $20 million franchise tag is too much is
   perfectly valid. But the salary cap is going up roughly $10 million
   from last year and salaries are growing as well. It used to be that a
   $20 million salary meant Tom Brady , Aaron Rodgers or Peyton Manning .
   That’s changing quickly. The Eagles could apply the franchise tag to
   Sam Bradford as early as this afternoon. It is interesting that
   Barnwell suggests the Eagles replace Bradford with Kansas City Chiefs
   backup Chase Daniel . Daniel has spent the last three years working for
   Doug Pederson, so there is a natural fit there.

   But let’s look at this another way.

   Why would a team want a former No. 1 overall draft pick who was deemed
   expendable by his original team? That describes Bradford well enough.
   But it also describes Alex Smith , the starter in Kansas City.

   Smith was the first overall pick in the 2005 NFL draft. He started for
   the San Francisco 49ers for seven years. During those seasons, Smith
   missed 27 games because of injuries. He had shoulder problems but also
   missed games because of a thumb injury and a concussion.

   Bradford was the first overall pick in the 2010 draft. He started for
   the St. Louis Rams for five years. Bradford missed 31 games because of
   injuries. The most serious were the two tears to his left ACL, which
   cost him nine games in 2013 and the entire 2014 season.

   Smith didn’t play in a playoff game until after his sixth season.
   Bradford has played six seasons without reaching the playoffs.

   The 49ers, with Colin Kaepernick emerging as a star, decided to trade
   Smith in […]

[102]Why the Eagles shouldn’t tag Sam Bradford

   February 16, 2016
   [103]Why the Eagles shouldn't tag Sam Bradford

   Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Jordan Matthews (81) is congratulated
   by quarterback Sam Bradford (7) after scoring a touchdown against the
   New York Giants on Jan. 3. (Kathy Willens / AP) Even if the Eagles are
   considering using the franchise tag on Sam Bradford , their potential
   free-agent quarterback, there’s no sense doing it today, which is the
   first allowed by the NFL for such a designation.

   The team still is ostensibly locked in a poker game with Bradford and
   his agent, Tom Condon, and there’s no reason for the Eagles to show
   their hand this early in the game. They have until March 1 to use it.

   If the Eagles use the non-exclusive franchise tag, which would still
   allow him to sign with another team if that team surrenders two
   first-round picks to the Eagles for the right, they would have to pay
   him around $20 million this year. That’s the estimated equivalent of
   what the top five paid players at his position have averaged over the
   last five years.

   An exclusive tag, which rarely is used by anyone, does not allow for
   negotiations with other teams but guarantees the player the equivalent
   of the average of the top five players in just this coming year, which
   could mean a significantly higher tender — say $24 million.

   Anyway, the Eagles aren’t using either of them on anyone anytime soon.
   And if they do elect to franchise Bradford, it won’t be until around
   1.5 seconds before the deadline. It wouldn’t make sense for them to do
   it before that.

   As it stands, if they still want him, maybe the best way to get him
   signed to a cap-friendly deal would be to let the market decide things.
   If they can’t compete with some big-spending team, they obviously would
   have to move on.

   For now, it’s a high-stakes staredown, and there’s too many twists and
   turns that can happen between now and the end of free agency.

   Now, as far as that goes, fans have to wonder about the thinking behind
   this covert master plan to hire a personnel specialist in light of
   another ex-Eagles employee being snagged for a prominent role on
   Monday.

   Former Eagles scout John Spytek, who later became the director of
   college scouting for the Cleveland Browns , was a national scout for
   the Denver Broncos this past season until being hired by Tampa Bay as
   its new director of player personnel.

   Spytek is considered a […]

[105]Franchise tags will take guys Titans should like off the board

   [106]Franchise tags will take guys Titans should like off the board

   play A look at the numbers shows why the Bears can’t afford to let
   Alshon Jeffery walk. (0:59) NASHVILLE, Tenn. — The more good players
   that come to market, the better for the Tennessee Titans .

   They have a load of needs and plenty of money. They can spend and solve
   some of their problems in free agency. Having a lot of options is good
   for them. It could also dilute the market for Guy B if another team
   with a similar need prefers Guy A.

   Franchise tags can be applied starting Tuesday, and the Titans have no
   worthy eligible player. Plenty of other teams will use theirs if they
   can’t reach long-term accords with valuable guys.

   NFL Nation ran through every team’s most likely tag scenario .

   If our reads are correct, tags will take several potential Titans
   targets out of play.

   The top three:

   Chiefs safety Eric Berry : He would be a home run worth breaking the
   bank for, but he’s the youngest of the Chiefs’ top free agents and
   absolutely worth the tag if a long-term deal cannot be reached.

   Bears receiver Alshon Jeffery : There are concerns about him staying
   healthy, but has proved extremely dangerous and productive. He would be
   extra appealing because this year’s draft doesn’t seem to have the sort
   of high-end receivers with all the qualities we’ve seen in recent
   years.

   Panthers cornerback Josh Norman : He’s coming off an excellent season
   for the NFC champs and has the sort of ball skills the Titans’ crop
   consistently fails to show.

   Others of note: Broncos edge rusher Von Miller , Buccaneers running
   back Doug Martin , Rams cornerback Janoris Jenkins (more likely to get
   transition tag).

   Odds are none of these players will hit the market. If they did, the
   Titans could pursue them or benefit from someone else signing them, as
   that team then would be less inclined to draft a player at the same
   position.

[108]Why drafting Laremy Tunsil isn’t giving up on Taylor Lewan

   February 16, 2016
   [109]Why drafting Laremy Tunsil isn't giving up on Taylor Lewan

   There is some conversation today on the Midday 180 , about how taking
   Laremy Tunsil is giving up on the Tennessee Titans current left tackle
   Taylor Lewan. While it is early in the offseason, this is more of a
   conversation of philosophy than how good a player is. So with that said
   here is why I disagree with that idea.

   More From Draft

   First of all, Laremy Tunsil is probably the best offensive tackle
   prospect to come out since Joe Thomas to me. He is a very complete run
   blocker who is nasty and physical. On the other hand he has elite
   technique in pass protection and on the one out of 100 times that he
   gets beat he recovers incredibly well.

   He is currently the top rated player on my board and I love Joey Bosa
   and Jalen Ramsey, so don’t think it is any discrimination against them.

   LIVE Feed Titans Laremy Tunsil is the Perfect Fit for the Tennessee
   Titans NFL Mocks

   Taking an elite player like Tunsil is by no means giving up on a player
   you drafted outside of the top 10 in a draft two years ago. It is
   admitting that you can see the way the league is trending, and that you
   can adapt.

   In the Super Bowl this year, it wasn’t the left tackle that Von Miller
   was beating to get his sacks, it was the right tackle. The day is over
   where you can put your slow, mean guy at right tackle and let him be
   your “mauler”. Defensive coordinators know that if they attack the
   right side with speed, you are more likely to win.

   With that in mind, why isn’t Taylor Lewan the perfect right tackle? He
   has always been exceptionally mobile and he did get some experience at
   right tackle in practice during his rookie year. Would you rather the
   Titans have a slow, strong guy deal with a team’s second best pass
   rusher like Jadeveon Clowney and Bjoern Werner next year, or would you
   rather have someone you can trust in one-on-one situations?

   No one has talked about the fact that it is also the most “economical”
   move in the 2016 NFL Draft, barring a trade back which is no certainty
   by any means. This upgrades your roster at left tackle, gives you a
   quality starter at right tackle and it allows you to kick Jeremiah
   Poutasi inside to left guard […]

[111]NFL Trade Rumors: Tennessee Titans Interested In Moving No.1 Overall
Draft Pick?

   February 16, 2016
   [112]NFL Trade Rumors: Tennessee Titans Interested In Moving No.1
   Overall Draft Pick?

   Marcus Mariota was taken second overall by the Tennessee Titans in the
   2015 NFL Draft. It’s been 12 years since the team with the No.1 overall
   pick in the NFL Draft traded the top selection, but that streak could
   be broken in 2016. The first pick in this year’s draft belongs to the
   Tennessee Titans, and the team is exploring the possibility of making a
   move.

   Tennessee finished the 2015 regular season with the NFL’s worst record
   at 3-13, and they have plenty of holes to fill. The Titans could start
   to improve by trading the top pick for multiple selections in the
   draft.

   “I’ve had a couple of conversations here and there. I think it is
   really more kind of exploratory at this point,’’ Titans general manager
   Jon Robinson said via the team’s official website . “As we get a little
   bit closer, a little bit more through the process with the combine and
   interviews and pro days, I expect there will be a few more exploratory
   calls, and there may not be. We’ll see.”

   The San Diego Chargers were the last team to trade the No.1 overall
   pick, sending it to the New York Giants, who took Eli Manning in the
   2004 NFL Draft. The Chargers received the No.4 overall pick in the 2004
   draft, taking Philip Rivers with New York’s selection. They also got a
   2004 third-round pick (kicker Nate Kaeding) and a 2005 first-round pick
   (linebacker Shawne Merriman), as well as a 2005 fifth-round pick.

   After picking Marcus Mariota with the No.2 pick in last year’s draft,
   the Titans already have their quarterback of the future. It’s rare that
   a signal caller isn’t taken first overall, giving Tennessee more
   incentive to trade down. A quarterback has been taken first overall in
   11 of the last 15 drafts.

   California’s Jared Goff is the first quarterback projected to be picked
   this year, and he’s likely to go to the Cleveland Browns at No.2
   overall if the Titans keep their pick. A team like the St. Louis Rams,
   who need a quarterback but have the No.15 overall pick, could be a
   possible trading partner for Tennessee.

   Four years ago, the Rams traded the No.2 overall pick to the Washington
   Redskins, who selected Robert Griffin III. St. Louis turned that pick
   into eight players that have made a combined 158 starts for the Rams.

   Robinson says he will weigh his options before trading the top pick […]
