[18]8 Books You Can Read In The Time It Takes To Watch The Super Bowl

   According to Nielsen Holdings, the average length of a Super Bowl
   broadcast is 3 hours and 35 minutes. We’ve rounded up eight quick reads
   you can cover in less time than it takes to watch the biggest game of
   the year.

   [19]The Ballad of Ballard And Sandrine  by Peter Straub

   Or, the polar opposite of The Super Bowl. Two lovers are widely
   separated in age but bound together by an erotic obsession. Their
   story, which takes place over a period of twenty-five years, is
   primarily set on a mysterious yacht making its way down the Amazon
   river. Straub’s dark novel combines horror, love, and suspense in an
   entirely new and unexpected way.


   Le-Petit-Prince

   [20]Little Prince by Antoine de Saint Exupery

   This little book is as widely read as the Super Bowl is watched, and
   has become a cult favorite among readers around the world. The synopsis
   — an aviator whose plane is forced down in the Sahara Desert encounters
   a little prince from a small planet who relates his adventures in
   seeking the secret of what is important in life — is simple, but this
   sweet little title packs an enormous punch.

   [21]A River Runs Through It by Norman Maclean

   “In our family, there was no clear line between religion and fly
   fishing.” This book celebrates a different American pastime and is
   based on the author’s childhood fishing in Montana’s Big Blackfoot
   River. Though more widely known for the movie, this tale of nature and
   family is a short, but exquisite classic.


   41WxxnyABjL._SX301_BO1,204,203,200_ [22]Franny and Zooey by JD Salinger

   If you’re a fast reader, you can cover this text in a single sitting.
   “Franny” debuted in The New Yorker in 1955 and was soon followed by the
   novella, “Zooey” in 1957. Together they tell the story of the two
   youngest members of the Glass family, a subject frequently covered by
   Salinger. He writes: “I love working on these Glass stories, I’ve been
   waiting for them most of my life, and I think I have fairly decent,
   monomaniacal plans to finish them with due care and all-available
   skill.”

   [23]The Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy by Douglas Adams

   As beloved at the Super Bowl, this small little book wins over
   absolutely every one of its readers. Seconds before the Earth is
   demolished to make way for a galactic freeway, Arthur Dent is plucked
   off the planet by his friend Ford Prefect, a researcher for the revised
   edition of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy who, for the last
   fifteen years, has been posing as an out-of-work actor. Together this
   dynamic pair begin a journey through space aided by quotes from The
   Hitchhiker’s Guide. It’s too fun not to read.


   [24]sleep-donation [25]Sleep Donation by Karen Russell

   In less time than it takes to get to the halftime show, transport
   yourself with Karen Russell’s novella about an insomnia epidemic turned
   deadly. In this story, Russell’s protagonist, Trish, works for an
   organization called Slumber Corps, traveling the country telling the
   story of her sister’s death in hopes of gather “sleep donations” from
   healthy sleepers. In [26]our review of the novella Sadye Teiser writes:
   “…we may be alone in our dreams, but as Sleep Donation shows us, we are
   useless without them.”

   [27]jackson [28]We Have Always Lived in The Castle by Shirley Jackson

   Shirley Jackson’s novel about the Blackwood sisters who live in
   isolation on the outskirts of town is a mysterious tale about a dark
   family secret. This scary story is quick and complex, and will keep you
   on your toes throughout. You won’t soon forget the agoraphobic
   Constance and the increasingly volatile Merricat.


   [29]vandermeer [30]Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeer

   Jeff VandeerMeer guest judged our [31]Fall Fiction Contest this year so
   it’s no surprise we’re fans of his work. And if you haven’t read
   Annihilation, the first book in his Southern Reach trilogy, you should
   start immediately. It’s a story about Area X, which has been cut off
   from the rest of the continent for decade. It begins with an expedition
   to provide information on this strange land. An anthropologist,
   surveyor, psychologist, and biologist must gather data and avoid
   contamination if they hope to return home.
