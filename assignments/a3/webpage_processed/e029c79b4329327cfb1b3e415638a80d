Customer Reviews

Great game!


   by Beezou11

   It's nice to see a great one player game since most games seem to focus
   on playing with others. This game has a ton of challenging levels that
   take some brain power to get through. It's a blast and totally
   addicting, and the attention to detail in the graphics adds to the
   enjoyment! It has easily become one of my favorite games!
   One suggestion/complaint: At the end of a round, please separate the
   option to Give Up from the one above which always asks us to use coins
   to purchase additional tries and is much bigger in size than a Give Up.
   I know that's your intent but too often I thought I was hitting Give Up
   only to find I just spent 9 coins to purchase more moves. That's a bad
   user experience so please fix that.
   Also, the Boston update has a different feel than the rest of the
   levels. The phrases have nothing to do with Boston the way the phrases
   in all the other levels relate to the location. This level is also
   incredibly easy and that takes all the fun out of it. Please make
   future updates like the old game was - I love that game! I don't love
   Boston.

Communication between iPhone and iPad


   by sgmcam

   I really like this game. The one problem I have is that it will not
   keep current on both devices. Words with friends you can go into either
   device and the game is current. But with words tour there is no
   communication between the two devices. Therefore but I want to use my
   iPad I am not at the same level as when I use my iphone. It would be
   appreciated if this could be corrected. There are times when I would
   like to play the game on my iPad but it is prohibitive because it is
   not current with my iPhone. This really needs to be corrected and
   updated! Now I can only play the game on my iPhone because I am on a
   much lower level on my iPad.

Enjoyed... But


   by Belizebae

   Initially, I enjoyed the game very much. Lower levels , puzzles and
   occasional money being spent. Ok. Think the earning coins has always
   really sucked. I am now at level 315. Have emailed for advice , went
   thru videos (they don't have a video for 315), the game freezes and
   then if you did use a coin you lost it. I play game for enjoyment not
   frustration. Some of you newbies just think it's wonderful! I am
   deleting this app. It takes up memory and I am wasting my time. I will
   not give any good reviews in future. The app just takes our money and
   we are paying truly for nothing. To bad. It's a great game or was!!!!
