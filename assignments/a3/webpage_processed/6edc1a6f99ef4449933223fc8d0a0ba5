   CSK has been a great franchise to work for: Andy Bichel

   New Delhi: Former Australian pacer Andy Bichel worked with the Chennai
   Super Kings (CSK) for five seasons before the team was suspended, along
   with Rajasthan Royals, for two years from taking part in the Indian
   Premier League (IPL).

   While most of the players have been ‘rehabilitated’ by the BCCI, the
   support staff of the two teams, including Bichel, who worked as bowling
   coach for the CSK from 2011 to 2015, is still looking for the
   opportunities to get associated with cash-rich league.

   With the IPL players’ auction done and dusted, Bichel is hoping that he
   will again be able to work in the IPL – he is in talks with the Rising
   Pune Supergiants that has managed to bring together the core group of
   the CSK including captain MS Dhoni and coach Stephen Fleming.

   “Nothing has been finalised. Obviously (sent) a few texts and a few
   resumes. I’m still hoping,” he told The Hindu.

   “You can only put your name forward and hope that you make that final
   interview. Stephen Fleming is someone I have had a great relationship
   with and we have had some great success in Chennai. So, to be able to
   keep working with him would be a privilege, really. Because I really
   enjoyed that combination,” he added.

   The 45-year-old Bichel, who played 19 Tests and 67 ODIs for Australia,
   says he is ‘sad’ for the ‘great franchise’ CSK for which they worked
   very hard over the years to make it the most successful team in the
   IPL.

   “It’s sad. Very sad. After we’ve worked so hard for everything. And the
   management have been absolutely fantastic. It’s been a great franchise
   to work for. All the players in the competition wanted to play for
   Chennai.

   “You had the Indian captain there in MS Dhoni. Stephen Fleming had a
   good rapport across the tournament as well.

   “And the owners, what they’ve done for Chennai and the Chennai Super
   Kings has been outstanding… the way they’ve conducted themselves. It’s
   sad that it’s all broken down. Let’s hope it can come back but it’ll
   never be the same. And that’s probably the saddest part about the whole
   scenario that’s unfolded,” Bichel said.

   Chennai Super Kings’ record in the IPL has been phenomenal with two
   titles from six final appearances. So what is the secret?

   “It’s getting the right people to fit the roles. And if that person is
   not quite right, then it’s having someone to replace him.

   “Brendon McCullum coming into the team last year was good for us,
   because we needed that person upfront when we lost Murali Vijay.

   “Albie Morkel, the role he played lower down the order, coming in and
   getting 14 off five balls or whatever, he did that regularly. Dwayne
   Bravo’s done that for us. When we wanted someone upfront swinging the
   ball, we had Ben Hilfenhaus, Doug Bollinger. It took hard work behind
   the scenes, from Stephen Fleming and the management at CSK,” Bichel
   revealed.

   One of the biggest success stories of the CSK has been Ravichandran
   Ashwin and Bichel complimented the off-spinner by calling him a
   workaholic.

   “He’s always improving his game. He’s always working. He probably
   over-trains a little bit, and that’s not a bad thing, because you’re
   always working on something,” he said.
