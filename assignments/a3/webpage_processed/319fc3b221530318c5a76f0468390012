   For The NFL's 1st And Future
   Virtual reality, body cameras, and the Internet Of Things are poised to
   change the way we watch sports. Today we saw how at TechCrunch’s
   [103]1st And Future startup competition held at the Stanford Graduate
   School of Business. The home viewing category winner, [104]LiveLike,
   lets you watch games in virtual reality from multiple angles.

   The contest featured twelve finalists competing in three different
   categories: The Future Stadium, Bringing Home The Game, and Tomorrow’s
   Athlete. Each company got five minutes to pitch to our panel of judges
   like all-star investor Mary Meeker and Condoleezza Rice. Winners walked
   away with $50,000 in cash plus meetings with NFL execs and tickets to
   the Super Bowl tomorrow.

   [105]You can watch all the pitches and judging here, starting at about
   the one hour mark.

   The competitors in Bringing Home The Game made traditional television
   viewing look boring.

   [108]First V1sion is an athlete body camera system that allows for the
   live broadcast of a player’s point of the view during the game. The
   camera and transmitter are safely woven into the player’s uniform and
   are designed not to impede performance. The camera sends the footage to
   an editing bay at the stadium where it can be integrated into the
   broadcast. First V1sion has a pilot planned with the Dallas Cowboys,
   plus hockey, handball, and track teams. Plus, it has soccer star Andres
   Iniesta and basketball player Serge Ibaka as stakeholders.

   [109]Maestro is a social game-watching dashboard where fans can stream
   the game, interact with each other, buy merchandise, participate in
   polls, share snippets and more. Broadcasters can overlay sponsorship
   graphics and calls to action, highlight top social media posts, and
   gather data about viewers. Maestro takes a software-as-a-service
   subscription fee plus a cut of advertising and merch sales in exchange
   for providing the dashboard. Maestro already works with esports
   leagues, musicians like Deadmau5, music festivals like Electric Daisy
   Carnival, and Twitch.

   [110]Fanmode lets teams measure, visualize, and encourage audible
   cheering by their fans both in the stadium and at home. The volume of
   fan cheering is recorded by both smartphone apps and a small
   Internet-connected device that can attach to merchandise. Fanmode gives
   fans around the world a sense of the stadium, and pushes them to rally
   friends to watch.

   But the winner, LiveLike, wowed the judges by showing what sports
   watching will look like in the future thanks to virtual reality, rather
   than augmenting the past television

   LiveLike lets fans sit in a VR box suite and watch the game from
   multiple viewing angles like behind the goal or the 50-yard line. They
   can view several angles at once, or dive in to feel like they’re
   actually sitting on the edge of the field or court. Friends can watch
   together side by side so they don’t feel lonely in their VR headset.
   LiveLike view from the corner

   LiveLike already has partnerships with several teams and tournaments
   such as the French Open tennis, and is set to broadcast VR streams of
   dozens of upcoming events.

   Thanks to low-cost VR headsets like Google Cardboard and the Samsung
   Gear VR, virtual reality has seen an explosion in distribution.
   LiveLike viewers won’t need an expensive wired headset like the Oculus
   Rift to watch sports. They’ll just strap their phone into a headset,
   choose their angle, and they’ll feel like they’re at the game.
