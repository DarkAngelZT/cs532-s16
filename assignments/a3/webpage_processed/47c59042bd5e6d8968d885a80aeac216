[8]7 Sports Astronauts Love Without Gravity (Including Football)

   Astronauts onboard the [9]International Space Station spend most of
   their time doing science, exercising and maintaining the station. But
   they still have time to shoot hoops and toss around a football.

   From chess to soccer, there’s a zero-gravity spin to everything.

   1. Baseball
   image image image

   Baseball: America’s favorite pastime. JAXA astronaut, Satoshi Furukawa
   shows us how microgravity makes it possible to be a one-man team. It
   would be a lot harder to hit home runs if the players could jump that
   high to catch the ball.

   2. Chess
   image

   Yes, it’s a sport, and one time NASA astronaut Greg Chamitoff (right)
   played Earth on a Velcro chess board. An elementary school chess team
   would pick moves that everyone could vote for online. The winning move
   would be Earth’s play, and then Chamitoff would respond. About every
   two days, a move would be made. But who won the historic Earth vs.
   Space match? Earth! Chamitoff resigned after Earth turned its pawn into
   a queen, but it was game well played.

   3. Soccer
   image image

   NASA astronaut Steve Swanson put a new spin on soccer by juggling the
   ball upside down. However, he might not have considered himself upside
   down. On the space station, up and down are relative.

   4. Gymnastics
   image

   NASA astronauts usually sign off their videos with a zero-gravity
   somersault (either forwards or backwards). But astronauts are also
   proficient in handstands, flips and twists. The predecessor to the
   International Space Station, the [10]Skylab, had the best space for the
   moves. The current space station is a bit tight in comparison.

   5. Basketball
   image

   Objects that aren’t heavy don’t move very well on the space station.
   They kind of just float. It’s like Earth, but exaggerated. For example,
   on Earth a beach ball wouldn’t go as far as a basketball. The same is
   true in space, which is why playing with a basketball in space is more
   fun than playing with a beach ball.

   6. Golf
   image

   People talk about hitting golf balls off skyscrapers, but what about
   off the International Space Station? While golf isn’t a normal
   occurrence on the station, it’s been there. [11]One golf company even
   sent an experiment to the station to find out how to make better golf
   clubs.

   7. Football
   image

   Zero gravity doesn’t make everything easier. Astronauts need to relearn
   how to throw things because their brains need to relearn how to
   interpret sensory information. A bowling ball on the space station no
   longer feels as heavy as a bowling ball on Earth. When astronauts first
   throw things on the space station, everything keeps going too high.
   That would put a wrench in your spiral for a couple of months. But once
   you adjust, the perfect spiral will just keep spiraling!

[106]Top 10 Ways the Space Station is Helping Get Us to Mars

   Believe it or not, the International Space Station is [107]paving our
   way to Mars. Being the only microgravity laboratory in which
   long-duration investigations can take place, it provides deeper
   understanding of how the human body reacts to long-term spaceflight.
   Here are the top 10 ways the space station is helping us on our journey
   to the Red Planet:

   10: Communication Delays
   image

   Have you ever sent a text and got frustrated when it took longer than 3
   seconds to send? Imaging communicating from Mars where round-trip
   delays could take up to 31 minutes! Our [108]Comm Delay Assessment
   studies the effects of delayed communications for interplanetary crews
   that have to handle medical and other emergencies in deep space.

   9. Astronaut Functional Performance
   image

   After a long nights sleep, do you ever feel a bit clumsy when you first
   get out of bed? Imagine how crew members might feel after spending six
   months to a year in microgravity! Our [109]Field Test investigation is
   working to understand the extend of physical changes in astronauts who
   live in space for long periods of time, with an aim toward improving
   recovery time and developing injury prevention methods for future
   missions.

   8. Psychological Impacts of Isolation and Confinement
   image

   In order to study the behavioral issues associated with isolation and
   confinement, researchers evaluate the [110]personal journals of space
   station crew members. These study results provide information to help
   prepare us for longer duration spaceflight.

   7. Impacts on Vision
   image

   Did you know that long duration spaceflight can often cause changes to
   crew members’ vision? It can, and our [111]Ocular Health study monitors
   microgravity-induced visual impairment, as well as changes believed to
   arise from elevated intracranial pressure. All of this work hopes to
   characterize how living in microgravity can affect the visual, vascular
   and central nervous systems.

   6. Immune Responses
   image

   An important aspect of our journey to Mars is the need to understand
   how long-duration spaceflight affects they way crew members’ bodies
   defend agains pathogens. Our [112]Integrated Immune investigation
   collects and analyzes blood, urine and saliva samples from crew members
   before, during and after spaceflight to monitor changes in the immune
   system.

   5. Food for Long-Duration Crews
   image

   Just like a hiker preparing for a long trek, packing the foods that
   will give you the most energy for the longest amount of time is key to
   your success. This is also true for astronauts on long-duration
   missions. Our [113]Energy investigation measures a crew members’ energy
   requirements, which is a crucial factor needed for sending the correct
   amount of the right types of food to space.

   4. Exercise for Long-Term Missions
   image

   Rigorous exercise is already a regular part of astronauts’ routines,
   and continuing that focus will be critical to keeping crew members’
   bodies strong and ready for a mission to Mars and a healthy return to
   Earth. Our [114]Sprint investigation is studying the best combination
   of intensity and duration for exercise in space.

   3. Determine Best Habitat/Environment for Crews
   image

   Have you ever complained about your room being too small? Imagine
   living in cramped quarters with an entire crew for months on a Mars
   mission! Our [115]Habitability investigation collects observations that
   will help spacecraft designers understand how much habitable volume is
   required, and whether a mission’s duration impacts how much space crew
   members need.

   2. Growing Food in Space
   image

   There’s nothing like fresh food. Not only does it provide valuable
   nutrition for astronauts, but can also offer psychological benefits
   from tending and harvesting the crops. Our [116]Veggie investigation
   studies how to best utilize a facility aboard the space station for
   growing fresh produce in microgravity.

   1. Manufacturing Items in Space
   image

   When crews head to Mars, there may be items that are unanticipated or
   that break during the mission. Our [117]3-D Printing in Zero-G
   Technology Demonstration would give crews the ability to manufacture
   new objects on demand while in space.

[138]Normal Things…Done in a Not So Normal Way

   Floating around in zero gravity may sound like a blast, but it can
   actually present a lot of challenges to things we do everyday here on
   Earth with little to no thought. Here are a few ways that astronauts on
   the [139]International Space Station complete normal tasks in orbit:

   1) Washing Hair
   image

   You can’t just have a shower on the space station because the water
   would come out of the faucet and float all over the place. In this
   video, NASA Astronaut Karen Nyberg [140]demonstrates how she uses a bag
   of water, no rinse shampoo, a towel and her comb to wash her hair.

   2) Drinking Coffee
   image

   Believe it or not, there are special cups used on the space station to
   [141]drink coffee from the new [142]ISSpresso machine. I mean, you
   wouldn’t want hot coffee floating around in the air…would you?
   Previously, astronauts drank coffee from plastic bags, but let’s face
   it, that sounds pretty unenjoyable. Now, there are [143]zero Gravity
   coffee cups, and an Italian espresso machine aboard the International
   Space Station! These cups were created with the help of capillary flow
   experiments conducted in space.

   3) Sleeping
   image

   There’s nothing like crawling into bed after a long day, but astronauts
   can’t exactly do that while they’re in microgravity. Instead of beds,
   crew members use [144]sleeping bags attached to the walls of their
   small crew cabins. They are able to zipper themselves in so that they
   don’t float around while they’re asleep. This may sound uncomfortable,
   but some astronauts, like [145]Scott Kelly, say that they sleep better
   in space than they do on Earth!

   4) Exercising
   image

   [146]Exercising in general is an important part of a daily routine. In
   space, it even helps prevent the effects of bone and muscle loss
   associated with microgravity. Typically, astronauts exercise two hours
   per day, but the equipment they use is different than here on Earth.
   For example, if an astronaut wants to [147]run on the treadmill, they
   have to wear a harness and bungee cords so that they don’t float away.

[164]The One-Year Mission

   First off, what is the One-Year Crew? Obviously, they’re doing
   something for a year, but what, and why?

   Two crew members on the International Space Station have just met the
   halfway point of their year in space. NASA Astronaut Scott Kelly and
   Russian Cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko are living in space for 342 days
   and will help us better understand the effects of microgravity on the
   human body.

   Why 342 days and not 365? Thought you might ask. Due to crew rotation
   schedules, which involve training timelines and dictate when launches
   and landings occur, the mission was confined to 342 days. Plenty of
   time to conduct great research though!
   image

   The studies performed throughout their stay will yield beneficial
   knowledge on the medical, psychological and biomedical challenges faced
   by astronauts during long-duration spaceflight.

   The weightlessness of the space environment has [165]various effects on
   the human body, including: [166]Fluid shifts that cause changes in
   vision, [167]rapid bone loss, disturbances to sensorimotor ability,
   weakened muscles and more.

   The goal of the One-Year Mission is to understand and minimize these
   effects on humans while in space.

   The Twins Study
   image

   A unique investigation that is being conducted during this year in
   space is the [168]Twins Study. NASA Astronaut Scott Kelly’s twin
   brother Mark Kelly will spend the year on Earth while Scott is in
   space. Since their genetic makeup is as close to identical as we can
   get, this allows a unique research perspective. We can now compare all
   of the results from Scott Kelly in space to his brother Mark on Earth.

   But why are we studying all of this? If we want to move forward with
   our journey to Mars and travel into deep space, astronauts will need to
   live in microgravity for long periods of time. In order to mitigate the
   effects of long duration spaceflight on the human body, we need to
   understand the causes. The One-Year mission hopes to find these
   answers.

   Halfway Point
   image

   Today, September 15 marks the [169]halfway point of their year in
   space, and they now enter the final stretch of their mission.

   Here are a few fun tidbits on human spaceflight to put things in
   perspective:

   1) Scott Kelly has logged 180 days in space on his three previous
   flights, two of which were Space Shuttle missions.

   2) The American astronaut with the most cumulative time in space is
   Mkie Fincke, with 382 days in space on three flights. Kelly will
   surpass this record for most cumulative time in space by a U.S.
   astronaut on October 16.

   3) Kelly will pass Mike Lopez-Alegria’s mark for most time on a single
   spaceflight (215 days) on October 29.

   4) By the end of this one-year mission, Kelly will have traveled for
   342 days, made 5,472 orbits and traveled 141.7 million miles in a
   single mission.

   Have you seen the amazing images that Astronaut Scott Kelly has shared
   during the first half of his year in space? Check out this collection,
   and also follow him on social media to see what he posts for the
   duration of his #YearInSpace: [170]Facebook, [171]Twitter,

[190]5 Myths About Becoming an Astronaut

   Have you ever wondered if you have what it takes to become a NASA
   Astronaut? The term “astronaut” derives from the Greek word meaning
   “space sailor,” and refers to all who have been launched as crew
   members aboard NASA spacecraft bound for orbit and beyond.

   We’re looking for a new class of astronauts to join the NASA team, and
   here are a few things to know.

Here are a few myths about [191]becoming an astronaut:

   MYTH: All astronauts have piloting experience.

   FACT: You don’t need to be a pilot to be an astronaut. Flying
   experience is not a requirement, but could be beneficial to have.
   image

   MYTH: All astronauts have perfect vision.

   FACT: It’s okay if you don’t have 20/20 vision. As of September 2007,
   corrective surgical procedures of the eye (PRK and LASIK), are now
   allowed, providing at least 1 year has passed since the date of the
   procedure with no permanent adverse after effects.
   image

   MYTH: All astronauts have advanced degrees like, a PhD.

   FACT: While a Bachelor’s degree from an accredited university is
   necessary, an advanced degree is not required to become an astronaut.
   image

   MYTH: Astronauts are required to have military experience in order to
   be selected.

   FACT: Military experience is not required to become an astronaut.
   image

   MYTH: You have to be a certain age in order to be an astronaut.

   FACT: There are no age restrictions. Astronaut candidates selected in
   the past have ranged between the ages of 26 and 46, with the average
   age being 34.

     __________________________________________________________________

Okay, but What are the requirements?

   image

   Basic Qualification Requirements

   Applicants must meet the following minimum requirements before
   submitting an application.
     * Bachelor’s degree from an accredited institution in engineering,
       biological science, physical science or mathematics.
     * Degree must be followed by at least 3 years of related,
       progressively responsible, professional experience or at least
       1,000 pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. An advanced degree is
       desirable and may be substituted for experience as follows:
       master’s degree = 1 year of experience, doctoral degree = 3 years
       of experience.  Teaching experience, including experience at the K
       - 12 levels, is considered to be qualifying experience for the
       Astronaut Candidate position; provided degree is in a Science,
       Engineering, or Mathematics field.
     * Ability to pass the NASA Astronaut physical, which includes the
       following specific requirements:

     * Distant and near visual acuity: Must be correctable to 20/20, each
       eye

     * The refractive surgical procedures of the eye, PRK and LASIK, are
       allowed, providing at least 1 year has passed since the date of the
       procedure with no permanent adverse after effects.  For those
       applicants under final consideration, an operative report on the
       surgical procedure will be requested.

Applications for our next astronaut class open on Dec. 14!

[210]13 Reasons to Have an Out of this World Friday (the 13th)

   1. Know that not all of humanity is bound to the ground
   image

   Since 2000, the [211]International Space Station has been continuously
   occupied by humans. There, crew members live and work while conducting
   important research that benefits life on Earth.

   2. Smart people are up all night working in control rooms all over NASA
   to ensure that data keeps flowing from our satellites
   image

   Our [212]satellites help scientists study Earth and space. Satellites
   looking toward Earth provide information about clouds, oceans, land and
   ice. They also measure gases in the atmosphere, such as ozone and
   carbon dioxide, and the amount of energy that Earth absorbs and emits.
   And satellites monitor wildfires, volcanoes and their smoke.

   Satellites that face toward space have a variety of jobs. Some watch
   for dangerous rays coming from the sun. Others explore asteroids and
   comets, the history of stars, and the origin of planets. Some
   satellites fly near or orbit other planets. These spacecraft may look
   for evidence of water on Mars or capture close-up pictures of Saturn’s
   rings.

   3. When we are ready to send humans to Mars, they’ll have the most high
   tech space suits ever made
   image

   Our [213]Z-2 Spacesuit is the newest prototype in its next-generation
   platform, the Z-series. Each iteration of the Z-series will advance new
   technologies that one day will be used in a suit worn by the first
   humans to step foot on the red planet.

   4. When we need more space in space, it could be just like inflating a
   big high-tech balloon
   image

   The [214]Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, or BEAM, leverages key
   innovations in lightweight and compact materials, departing from a
   traditional rigid metallic structure. Once attached to the
   International Space Station, the module would result in an additional
   565 cubic feet of volume, which is about the size of a large family
   camping tent.

   5. Even astronauts eat their VEGGIE’s
   image

   The [215]Vegetable Production System (VEGGIE) is a deployable plant
   growth unit capable of producing salad-type crops in space. Earlier
   this year, Expedition 44 crew members, [216]sampled the red romaine
   lettuce from the VEGGIE plant growth system. This technology will
   provide future pioneers with a sustainable food supplement during
   long-duration exploration missions.

   6. When you feel far away from home, you can think of the New Horizons
   spacecraft as it heads toward the Kuiper Belt…billions of miles away
   image

   Our [217]New Horizons spacecraft completed its Pluto flyby on July 14,
   and has continued on its way toward the [218]Kuiper Belt. The
   spacecraft continues to send back important data as it travels toward
   deeper space at more than 32,000 miles per hour, and is nearly 3.2
   billion miles from Earth.

   7. Earth has a magnetic field that largely protects it from the solar
   wind stripping away our atmosphere…unlike Mars
   image

   Recently announced findings from our [219]MAVEN mission have identified
   the process that appears to have played a key role in the
   [220]transition of the Martian climate from an early, warm and wet
   environment to the cold, arid planet Mars is today. MAVEN data have
   enabled researchers to determine the rate at which the Martian
   atmosphere currently is losing gas to space via stripping by the solar
   wind. Luckily, Earth has a magnetic field that largely protects it from
   this process.

   8. Water bubbles look REALLY cool in space
   image

   Astronauts on the International Space Station dissolved an effervescent
   tablet in a [221]floating ball of water, and captured images using a
   camera capable of recording four times the resolution of normal
   high-definition cameras. The higher resolution images and higher frame
   rate videos can reveal more information when used on science
   investigations, giving researchers a valuable new tool aboard the space
   station. This footage is one of the first of its kind.

   9. Americans will launch from U.S. soil again with the Commercial Crew
   Program
   image

   Our [222]Commercial Crew Program is working with the American aerospace
   industry as companies develop and operate a new generation of
   spacecraft and launch systems capable of carrying crews to low-Earth
   orbit and the International Space Station.

   10. You can see a global image of your home planet…EVERY DAY
   image

   Once a day, we will post at least a dozen [223]new color images of
   Earth acquired from 12 to 36 hours earlier. These images are taken by
   our EPIC camera from one million miles away on the [224]Deep Space
   Climate Observatory (DSCOVR). Take a look [225]HERE.

   11. Starting on December 14, you can apply to be an astronaut

[269]2000 vs Now: 15 Years of Humans on Space Station

   Humans have been living in space aboard the International Space Station
   24-7-365 since Nov. 2, 2000. That’s 15 Thanksgivings, New Years, and
   holiday seasons astronauts have spent away from their families. 15
   years of constant support from Mission Control Houston. And 15 years of
   peaceful international living in space.

   In November 2000, many of us stuck on Earth wished we could join (at
   least temporarily) the [270]Expedition 1 crew aboard the
   [271]International Space Station. Floating effortlessly from module to
   module, looking down on Earth from a breathtaking height of 350
   kilometers…. It’s a dream come true for innumerable space lovers.

   But be careful what you wish for! Living on the Space Station also
   means hard work, cramped quarters, and… what’s that smell? Probably
   more outgassing from a scientific experiment or, worse yet, a crewmate.

   To get a feel of how long ago that was, this is what the world looked
   like then vs. now:

[293]Space Food

   Food: everyone needs it to survive and in space there’s no exception.
   Let’s take a closer look at what astronauts eat while in space.
   image

   Since the start of human spaceflight, we’ve worked to improve the
   taste, texture and shelf life of food four our crews. Our food
   scientists are challenged with developing healthy menus that can meet
   all of the unique requirements for living and working in the extreme
   environment of space.
   image

   Consider the differences of living on Earth and in space. Food
   scientists must develop foods that will be easier to handle and consume
   in a microgravity environment. These food products require no
   refrigeration and provide the nutrition humans need to remain healthy
   during spaceflight.

   Freeze drying food allows food to remain stable at ambient
   temperatures, while also significantly reducing the weight.
   image

Fun Facts About Space Food:

   Astronauts use tortillas in many of their meals
   image

   [294]Tortillas provide an edible wrapper to keep food from floating
   away. Why tortillas and not bread? Tortillas make far less crumbs and
   can be stored easier. Bread crumbs could potentially float around and
   get stuck in filters or equipment.

   The first food eaten by an American astronaut in space: Applesauce
   image

   The first American astronaut to eat in space dined on applesauce
   squeezed from a no-frills, aluminum toothpaste-like tube. Since then,
   food technology has cooked up better ways to prepare, package and
   preserve space fare in a tastier, more appetizing fashion.

   All food that is sent to the space station is precooked
   image

   Sending precooked food means that it requires no refrigeration and is
   either ready to eat or can be prepared simply by adding water or by
   heating. The only exception are the fruit and vegetables stowed in the
   fresh food locker.

   Salt and pepper are used in liquid form on the International Space
   Station
   image

   Seasonings like salt and pepper have to be used in liquid form and
   dispensed through a bottle on the space station. If they were
   granulated, the particles would float away before they even reached the
   food.

   Food can taste bland in space
   image

   Some people who live in space have said that food is not the same while
   in microgravity. Some say that it tastes bland, some do not like their
   favorite foods and some love to eat foods they would never eat on
   Earth. We believe this phenomenon is caused by something called “stuffy
   head” This happens when crew member’s heads get stopped up because
   blood collects in the upper part of the body. For this reason, hot
   sauce is used A LOT on the space station to make up for the bland
   flavor.

   Astronaut ice cream is not actually eaten on the space station
   image

   Even though astronaut ice cream is sold in many science centers and
   enjoyed by many people on Earth, it’s not actually sent to the space
   station. That said, whenever there is space in a freezer heading to
   orbit, the astronauts can get real ice cream onboard!

   Instead of bowls there are bags and cans
   image

   Most American food is stored in sealed bags, while most Russian food is
   kept in cans.

   Here’s what the crew aboard the space station enjoyed during
   Thanksgiving in 2015:
     * Smoked Turkey
     * Candied Yams
     * Rehydratable Corn
     * Potatoes Au Gratin

[310]300 Consecutive Days in Space!

   Today marks astronaut Scott Kelly’s 300th day in space! He, along with
   Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko, are testing the limits of human
   research during their [311]one-year mission onboard the
   [312]International Space Station.
   image

   While most expeditions to the space station last four to six months,
   their time on orbit has been doubled. By increasing the length of their
   time in space, researchers hope to better understand how the human body
   reacts and adapts to [313]long-duration spaceflight.

What happens when you’ve been in space for 300 days?

   1. You might get bored and play ping pong with yourself…and a water
   droplet.
   image

   2. There’s a chance that you’ll get a Tweet from someone famous…like
   the President!
   image

   3. There may come a time where you’ll have to fix something outside the
   station during a [314]spacewalk.
   image

   4. You might develop a ‘green thumb’ and [315]grow plants in space.
   image

   5. And, there’s no doubt you get to [316]see the Earth from a totally
   new perspective.

[334]Space Station Research: Nutrition

   image

   Each month, we highlight a different [335]research topic on the
   [336]International Space Station. In January, our focus is
   [337]Nutrition. Understanding the role of nutrition in astronaut
   adaptation to spaceflight has a broader application on Earth. For
   example, understanding the relationship of nutrition to bone loss in
   space is potentially valuable for patients suffering from bone loss on
   Earth.
   [tumblr_inline_o0wq88T8W91tzhl5u_400.jpg]

   The space station is being utilized to study the risks to human health
   that are inherent in space exploration. The human body changes in
   various ways in microgravity, and nutrition-related investigations help
   us understand and reduce those risks associated with those changes.
   Examples are:
     * Bone mineral density loss
     * Muscle atrophy
     * Cardiovascular deconditioning
     * Immune dysfunction
     * Radiation
     * and more

   Scientists can also test the effectiveness of potential countermeasures
   like [338]exercise and nutrition, which can have health benefits for
   those of us on Earth.
   image

   Did you know that in 2015 the space station crew harvested and [339]ate
   lettuce that was grown on the space station? The [340]Veggie facility
   on station is an experiment that supports a variety of plant species
   that can be cultivated for educational outreach, fresh food and even
   recreation for crew members on long-duration missions. Right now, the
   crew is growing [341]Zinnia flowers. Understanding how flowering plans
   grow in microgravity can be applied to growing other edible flowering
   plants, such as tomatoes.
