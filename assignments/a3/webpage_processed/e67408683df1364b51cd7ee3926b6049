Cam Newton exits post-game press conference

   Posted by Mike Florio on February 7, 2016, 11:24 PM EST
   Zz0zOTYwMjAwNmM4MmMzMWM5NzMyMGQyZjVmNDk1ZjljMw== AP

   Panthers quarterback [76]Cam Newton wasn’t smiling much on Sunday
   night. After the game, he wasn’t smiling at all.

   Newton, sullen and subdued, sat at his press conference for a limited
   time, saying hardly anything [77]before getting up and leaving. (The
   tweet from Cam Inman suggests it was less than a minute; others have
   said he was there for three minutes.)

   At some point, Newton will face questions about his curious decision
   not to aggressively pursue a loose ball that he had fumbled late in the
   fourth quarter. It was a move that some called a “business decision” on
   Twitter, with Newton choosing not to risk injury over trying to save
   the game.

   In his defense, he hadn’t been banged around and harassed the way he
   was in Super Bowl 50. After taking so much physical abuse, it would be
   hard for anyone to muster the will to take another big hit late in a
   game that likely felt like a lost cause regardless of whether Newton
   recovered the fumble.

   The challenge now will be to accept the reset to 0-0 and start climbing
   again.

       The real Cam shows up
    3. jimbo75025 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:27 PM
       Cam showed tonight that he is a front runner.
       Happy to clown it up when all is going well but when the worm turns
       he reverts back to the sullen look of two yeArs ago.
    4. rjpats says: Feb 7, 2016 11:28 PM
       Not ready for prime time. Maybe some day.
       Maybe not.
    5. eagleswin says: Feb 7, 2016 11:28 PM
       When some people ask why people don’t like his antics when he’s
       winning, part of it is he acts like a child when he loses.
    6. [91]mrwalterisgod says: Feb 7, 2016 11:28 PM
       Cam is a guy who is good when the going is good. When it gets tough
       he’s a sad, sorry little man.
    7. funshipm174 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:28 PM
       SMILE!
    8. [92]mkelly534 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:28 PM
       Newton needs to get his petulance under control. He is hurting his
       image by acting like a child when he should be standing tall and
       proud of his season
    9. [93]NYCTourGuy (Bucs fan) says: Feb 7, 2016 11:28 PM
       I like Cam. I thought he’d be a bust coming out of Auburn, and he’s
       completely proved me wrong.
       But he has some growing to do still. He has to understand his role
       as a leader. When they were behind late in the game, he should’ve
       still been clapping his hands saying “let’s go let’s go we can get
       this”. Instead he seemed resigned to defeat. The team feeds off
       that; they undoubtedly were resigned to defeat as well.
       Hopefully he’ll learn from this.
   10. [94]babygaga19 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:29 PM
       Camera Newton was exposed! Where are all the Panther fans that said
       this game would be an epic blowout? (crickets)
       Dab on Denver, Dab on!
   11. [95]mcjon22 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:29 PM
       Very Immature.
       You can’t dab and dance and bring all of that attention to yourself
       when you win if you won’t face the music when you lose.
       It’s a bad look.
   12. [96]gp1390r says: Feb 7, 2016 11:29 PM
       Manning always stayed and answered the questions after tough
       losses. So did/does Luck, Rodgers, and a bunch of others. This was
       a 12 year old clown show out of him. Pretty back look for such a
       big talker
   13. [97]fineswisswatches says: Feb 7, 2016 11:30 PM
       Interesting what a team can do with a very good physical defense, a
       decent running attack and a old average at best QB! The Patriots
       and alot of other teams could learn a thing or two from that!
   14. [98]dryzzt23 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:30 PM
       Choke Newton is what he’ll be known as from now on, at least IMO.
       He was SOOOO overhyped going into SB50 by the media that one had to
       wonder why the Broncos should even show up.
       They made Choke out to be some sort of “Superman”, which he clearly
       is not.
       Lesson to the media, STOP overhyping certain athletes, especially
       ones that you are trying to exploit (i.e. the media tried their
       hardest to exploit Choke’s race)
       Go Broncos!
   15. bobC927 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:30 PM
       As usual DEFENSE WINS CHAMPIONSHIPS.
   16. volum12 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:31 PM
       Scam Newton can dab-a-dab-dab all the way back to Carolina.
       Classless loser gets what he deserves.
   17. skolvike says: Feb 7, 2016 11:31 PM
       Was he channeling Jeff George?
   18. [99]mybrunoblog says: Feb 7, 2016 11:31 PM
       Weak. Very weak Newton.
   19. maddenisfordorks says: Feb 7, 2016 11:31 PM
       If I’d lost the Super Bowl, I’d show up to my press conferences
       hammered.
       Just sayin’
   20. [100]dkeucd says: Feb 7, 2016 11:31 PM
       Racism made him do it
   21. [101]jimsnchz says: Feb 7, 2016 11:31 PM
       You can’t Dab and take team pictures during a win then pull this
       crap. Gotta take it like a man. I heard the reporter asked “Are you
       wearing your Superman shirt under the hoodie?”
   22. couchbasher says: Feb 7, 2016 11:31 PM
       It’s a bird… it’s a plane… IT’S SUPERBABY!!!! LOL!!!
   23. [102]daytontriangles says: Feb 7, 2016 11:31 PM
       Brady got hit twice as much as Cam and still came within a tipped
       pass of taking his team to the Superbowl.
       Guess we can’t expect all QB’s, when faced with adversity, to have
       the same stones as the GOAT.
   24. [103]stillbilll says: Feb 7, 2016 11:31 PM
       But ……….. isn’t that what he’s paid to do ????
   25. chuckshontaspads says: Feb 7, 2016 11:31 PM
       Brady played like a warrior in a tough loss to the Broncos…Newton
       did not
   26. [104]blacknole08 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:32 PM
       Im just as shocked and upset by the loss, but I dont appreciate Cam
       doing this, especially since he has a long career ahead of him. It
       is ok to be upset. Today wasnt our day. We didnt get it done,
       accept it.

       Great leadership Cam. When the going gets tough…
   29. Dave Fouchey says: Feb 7, 2016 11:32 PM
       Cam behaved like a petulant spoiled brat.
   30. [106]dorn09 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:32 PM
       If he is the face of the nfl then the nfl needed to be punched in
       the face.
   31. jjsooner says: Feb 7, 2016 11:32 PM
       What a punk. And you think you should be mentioned among the greats
       in NFL history??? What??????
       Get better and buy some class if you can.
   32. Regassert6 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:33 PM
       It was a gutless performance on the field and a classless
       performance at the podium.
       Rewatch Peyton’s presser after Seattle crushed them a few years
       ago.
       Any other QB in the playoffs this year would have dove for that
       fumble. Manning dove for his and he’s 123 years old.
   33. [107]Chad says: Feb 7, 2016 11:33 PM
       Going for a loose fumble is risking injury. The guy dives
       recklessly into the end zone when he thinks he is going to score.
       Cam is all about showboating and that’s it. When the going gets
       tough, he slinks away and hides. He always has. He wasn’t concerned
       about injury, he just didn’t give a darn because the game is all
       about him and it’s all about him when he is winning and looking
       good. Funny he didn’t start “having fun” until this season when his
       team was 14-0 and clearly heading to the #1 seed in the playoffs.
       Cam is phony and that is why he gets criticized. But don’t worry
       the average idiot sports fans in this country is far too stupid to
       come to that conclusion, so the good news for Cam is he will be
       able to use any excuse he wants and get away with it.
   34. kennyrogerschicken says: Feb 7, 2016 11:33 PM
       Wah. Maybe some yogurt will help your mood.
   35. [108]lightninglucci says: Feb 7, 2016 11:33 PM
       This.
       This is why folks have been critical of Newton.
       When things go wrong, he pouts.
   36. [109]key2heat says: Feb 7, 2016 11:34 PM
       The true person was again exposed tonight.
   37. [110]rcampore says: Feb 7, 2016 11:34 PM
       I watched the presser and he was back to his immature whiny sore
       loser antics. One word answers, rolled his eyes at one point and
       then just walked out. And people wonder why some fans can’t stand
       him. He’s all bravado and smiles when things are going great but is
       a complete sore loser. It was a joy to see the smirk pummeled right
       off his face this evening.
   38. Wisconsin's Favorite Son Jeffrey Be Dahmed says: Feb 7, 2016 11:34
       PM
       Aaron taught that to Cam. Never risk yourself for your team.
   39. [111]polegojim says: Feb 7, 2016 11:34 PM
       Wow… really sad… expected much more.
       Easy to be gracious in Victory.
       Dab that.
   40. [112]ampatsisahypocrite says: Feb 7, 2016 11:34 PM
       So after all the moaning on TV about the persecution poor Cam has
       faced, and how you must be a racist if you don’t dig his act…
       Superman comes up with this.
       Wonder how Skip and Stephen A. will try and spin this one tomorrow?
   41. [113]johnrob1270 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:34 PM
       No class at all. He wasn’t able to perform for the Cam-cam tonight.
       NO GUTS. Freddie Coleman of ESPN wad a big defender of the kid and
       he said he should be ashamed of himself.
   42. [114]bigjonnyko says: Feb 7, 2016 11:34 PM
       the players who know how to win with respect also know how to lose
       with respect. Cam has shown neither and that’s sad. The league MVP
       acted like a spoiled child who was refused a lollipop before
       dinner. It’s too bad because he is the supposed “leader” of this
       Panther team and he showed no leadership tonight. He said earlier
       in the season, “if u don’t want me dabbing and doing the superman,
       then stop us from winning.” Guess he forgot he said that because he
       seemed confused his team wasn’t given the trophy.
   43. [115]mrmcdougle says: Feb 7, 2016 11:34 PM
       I believe Sherman said he played the game like a big kid. He
       handled that interview like a child as well.
   44. Wisconsin's Favorite Son Jeffrey Be Dahmed says: Feb 7, 2016 11:35

       Rodgers agrees. It’s a ‘me first’ league.
   45. [116]allidoiswin55 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:35 PM
       Cam is the best winner of all time &
       at the same time the WORST loser of all time!
       All we heard all year, more specifically this week is how Cam grew
       up and every time I heard that I threw up in my mouth a little! I
       DID NOT SEE THAT at all what I saw was winning clouding peoples
       opinions bc Cams great when he wins!
       Im sorry but Cam HAS NOT GROWN UP, you can pretend to give kids
       balls and be a team leader but then to turn around cry and pout and
       not stand up to simple questions on a stand! Get out of here with
       this nonsense!
       Cam disappointed me mainly bc his background is similar to mine and
       he has the ability with his celebrity and play to become a
       transitional player to our youth where any type of person can root
       for him but his sorry actions after losing RUIN his image as a
       whole!
   46. [117]zerotrophiessince1961 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:35 PM
       This is the kind of garbage that Cam pulls when things don’t go his
       way. It’s not racism saying that he’s a showboater when he wins. He
       proves it himself by not giving credit where it’s due and taking
       responsibility for his own actions when he loses.
   47. [118]ajg314 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:35 PM
       You know, a substantial portion of the country was rooting for the
       Broncos and especially Peyton Manning to go out as a winner. I’m a
       non-Broncos fan who was rooting for them to win. So, Broncos fans,
       you won. Why not win with a little class? Otherwise, you’re nothing
       more than another bunch of classless, trash talking jerks.
   48. [119]ctiggs says: Feb 7, 2016 11:35 PM
       not a big deal move along everyone handles a loss diffrently how
       wdo you want someone else to act? do you want them to tell you how
       to act
   49. [120]playsanity says: Feb 7, 2016 11:35 PM
       Cam & Stewart were the only ones to show up on offense tonight and
       the Refs refused to call clear fouls or CLEAR catches(even the
       announcers called bs multiple times). It was clear tonight that Cam
       lifted the talent around him during the season and not the other
       way around. Getting Benjamin back helps with the drops but Funchess
       needs more playing time as he seems to be the most consistent one
       currently outside of Olsen. This game proved more than any other
       game that Carolina’s defense is amazing(played just as good as
       Denver’s even without help from refs) but Cam is the only one that
       takes them to the next step. Without help around him Cam can only
       do so much.

       Aaron knows this is right. Don’t get hurt. There’s always a
       commercial to do.
   51. [121]jim699 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:36 PM
       When you dance as much as Cam does, people are going to really
       enjoy it when you lose. I know I sure do.
   52. [122]key2heat says: Feb 7, 2016 11:36 PM

   53. [123]yyc2phx says: Feb 7, 2016 11:36 PM
       I’ll take Cam Newton on my team… 14-2 was a good sample size as to
       what he can do…Age on his side… Not sure they repeat but good
       season overall…
   54. [124]dindunuffinz says: Feb 7, 2016 11:37 PM
       McDabb or McNabb?
   55. [125]mlenenski says: Feb 7, 2016 11:37 PM
       His left shoulder is probably separated. A loose ball pile on would
       have been a definite end to his game as well as many weeks of
       rehab…
   56. [126]campcre3k says: Feb 7, 2016 11:38 PM
       All week I said 24-20 Broncos and ppl laughed at me now who’s
       laughing 24-10 #NoFlyZone #DabOnThat
   57. sillymammo says: Feb 7, 2016 11:38 PM
       This has been the problem I’ve had with Cam and his celebrating.
       It’s all good and fine to smile and have a good time when you’re
       winning but a true leader is shown during the lean times. And I
       remember the sullen towel over his head when things weren’t going
       well. I think we’re seeing that now post game.
   58. jfcol says: Feb 7, 2016 11:38 PM
       Shocked we didn’t see the towel over the head. And while you’re at
       it, show some respect during the national anthem and stop hanging
       your chewing gum out of your mouth. Dang I sound like my
       grandfather, but seriously!

       Cam read Aaron Rodgers’ QB handbook. He doesn’t go for balls,
       though.
   60. fumblenuts says: Feb 7, 2016 11:38 PM
       Lost A LOT of respect for Newton….THIS IS THE SUPER BOWL, you may
       never be back again. Of course you try and get the ball back you
       fumbled!! Dude is just a FAKE Super Man. Russell Wilson would have
       dove for that football.
   61. staubach12ismyidol says: Feb 7, 2016 11:38 PM
       You cant spell Cam Newton without

       What time is the scheduled Super Bowl parade Tuesday
       in Charlotte? Idiots…
       Certainly made a lot of sense to plan a victory parade BEFORE the
       game is played.
       DOH!

       This is a good reminder to the media. Cams has haters not because
       of how he wins – but because how he loses. Their record has
       protected him from himself this year.
       He’s always been a sore loser – who resorts to blaming everybody
       else and whining.
   64. [128]bullcharger says: Feb 7, 2016 11:39 PM
       Cam had a great year. He’s the league MVP. He hates losing like
       every other great competitor. Needs to handle himself better then
       that, but he’ll learn.
       As for the fumble play, it actually was still a massive play in the
       game. Not sure what he was thinking, but I don’t think he was
       protecting himself. That’s short sited. I think he just was
       watching where the ball was squirting out.
       Carolina blew it in the first quarter with the Miller strip. That
       was enough to do it.
       Way too many mistakes by Carolina in that one to win a tight
       defensive battle.

       trophies and everyone else was pissed..a good loser is a loser
   67. [131]fmckenney says: Feb 7, 2016 11:40 PM
       Cam…don’t let this game define you. Try to be the bigger man and
       accept defeat and commit to an even better year in 2016. No one
       wants to watch you be the sullen loser no more than they wanted to
       watch the over the top ebullient winner.
       Good luck.

       It did seem like reporters were badgering him with the same

       with one word answers.

       I would have expected better from the NFL MVP. He has a lot to
       learn about being a standup guy. Brady, Manning, and all the other
       top-tier QBs may not like it but they do the post-game press
       conferences and answer questions like a professional. Newton?…not
       so much.

       Have all the fun you want when you win but also lose with class. In

       tone than if they would have lost.

       Cam looked as bored as I felt watching that snooze fest. If I’d
       known the most exciting part of the whole game was going to be Gaga
       killin it singing the anthem and that epic, perfectly timed Blue
       Angel flyover I could have maybe used those 4 hours I’ll never get
       back more wisely.

       If the Broncos defense saw his dad on 1st Take last Friday they had
       to walk away with some extra motivation to get busy tonight. It was
       all about Team Cam, like all they had to do was show up, check.
       Game over.
       Cam is probably more upset about the potential endorsements he
       lost, especially after his near melt down in the end zone. He’s
       still got a long way to go.
   78. [138]vikingjack73 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:43 PM
       The REAL Cam Newton showed his REAL colors
       Every loss is tough, but dignified, classy players bite the bullet
       and act accordingly
       THIS is why Cam Newton has critics!!!
       You can’t “dab” & “Superman” when you win, dance & fly around
       acting like the most “unique” player in the NFL, yet act like a
       petulant whiners when you lose!
       With Cam’s loss, players voted league MVP who pla Ed in the Super
       Bowl that same year…are only 5-13!
       Dab that, Cam!

       Peyton, Rodgers and Brady have all endured very tough losses, it’s

       answering every question and still mustering a smile and just
       appreciating the opportunity. Then after Cam, they show Luke
       Kuechly, who has a nice suit on, well groomed answering every

       The Panthers D is outstanding – very, very good. They need a game

       Entertainer and icon,everyone. He didn’t have an opponents

       I am tired of hearing people don’t like Cam because he is black.
       After watching him shy away from that fumble with the game on the
       line, I came to the conclusion he is actually YELLOW !!!!!
   102. Rdog says: Feb 7, 2016 11:52 PM
       Amazing! But they were such a FUN team! Oh so much FUN Cam Newton
       is having! What a role model! Oh wait…. The Denver Broncos KEPT
       POUNDING him all game long and he turns into the real Cam Newton.
       This is why people don’t like him. Not because he’s black… Not
       because he is “having fun.” It’s because he is very immature. Sure,
       he’s dancing and dabbing and taunting when he’s winning, but when
       he’s losing, he’s pouting and ignoring and … dabbing? No, no
       dabbing. Notice how much he celebrated the Panthers’ only touchdown
       of this game. He acted like he was the king, and they were still
       down by 3.
       When you dance and dab and celebrate so much, you better have a
       Super Bowl trophy to back it up. What a kid.

       Classless. Not suprised with his big mouth. It is easy to talk crap

       came out when things are.tough. He needed this himbling and where
       this leads to I really don’t know. I don’t know if he is going to
       grow up and gain some maturity and class.
   104. [148]nole53 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:53 PM
       The guy is a horrible loser. He went straight to the locker room

       hand. So, I’m not surprised he walked.
       Like I’ve said, I don’t hate the way Cam acts when he wins, I hate
       the way he acts when he loses.

   106. [149]rcampore says: Feb 7, 2016 11:53 PM
       The couple of commenters saying how should he have acted after
       losing. How about act like an adult and answers the questions. Yes
       it’s not fun, yes you are probably upset that you lost, but act
       like a damn professional. You are paid to talk when you win and
       when you lose. He’s not the first QB to lose a SB. There were 49
       QBs before him and I’m sure the majority of them didn’t want to be
       there and wanted to pout and not answer the difficult questions
       asked, but guess what, they did because they were adults!! The guys
       is very happy to talk and be in front of the camera dabbing and
       dancing when he’s winning but can’t be mature enough to take the
       heat when he loses. That is not a leader, and in the end, that will
       hurt the team overall if he doesn’t mature real quick.
   107. shadowshand says: Feb 7, 2016 11:53 PM
       Just because you’re the QB–or MVP–doesn’t mean you’re the leader,
       or even one of the leaders, of a team. To lead, you have to BE
       something, not just DO something. And he wasn’t a leader tonight
       when he had the chance and perhaps the responsibility. Watch the
       interviews with Olsen and Kuechly–they showed class, leadership and
       respect for both the Broncos and the game. Too bad for Newton,
       because there are no guarantees, and this may be the only time he
       gets to the SB. For him not to just take it all in as the
       culmination of a great season and the huge accomplishment it is,
       win or lose, it just sad.
   108. sullijo1 says: Feb 7, 2016 11:53 PM
       Look at the schedules of these teams again and you won’t be

       When thing start happening fast (like the Broncos pass rush) you
       have to be able to think fast. You can only get by so many times
       with your feet. Eventually you have to use your head, and Cam
       Newton isn’t going to win a lot of those kinds of battles. He’s a
       great front runner. He has a ton of physical talent and he plays on
       a very good team. The Panthers were on quite a roll this year, and
       Cam kind of liked grabbing all the attention. Now he has everyone’s
       attention and he gets up and walks out.

       Geez, Teddy Bridgewater and the Vikings played the Broncos tougher
       than Newton and the Panthers did.
       TB got sacked 7 times, but was 27/41 for 269 yards and 1 TD. They
       were close to pulling off a win when TB got strip-sacked near the
       end. Denver barely won 23-20.
       Newton probably out-weighs Teddy by 50 pounds. TB took his beating
       like a man and never blinked at the camera after any loss; class
       all the way.

       I know he was upset but it’s better to say nothing than to say
       something stupid. However, I wish he had prepared some short one
       liners in the event of a loss. Give him a brake. He’ll get better
       at this as he spends more time in the league. I’m glad Manning got
       his 2nd ring.

       This is vintage Narcissist Newton. As a division rival, I’ve seen
       his BS for years now. So glad he not only lost, but everyone got a
       chance to see his real game. Without a run game & high school
       trickery plays, narcissist Newton isn’t very effective. Cam’s
       “great” season has been greatly aided by playing subpar defense who
       almost beat them all season. His entire game is built upon the fact
       that he’s 6’5/240. It takes more than genetics to be a true Super
       Bowl winning true MVP QB.

       is nothing new to me or this franchise. That being said, I hope

       still didn’t give up. McNabb would have dove for the ball. Heck
       nearly 40 year old Peyton Manning whos neck is fused together put
       his body on the line and made a possible touchdown saving tackle.

       Get some class. I have never seen Brady or Manning give a post game
       like that. It’s a game, there is always one team that loses. 2
       weeks ago my beloved Patriots lost in the final seconds, none of
       them sat around sulking. After seeing that I’m even more happy for
       Payton and the Broncos. Congrats Bronco fans your team was truly
       the BETTER TEAM.

       In that situation you go after the ball.

       Essentially demonstrates why Brady’s willingness to throw himself
       on the ball like a grenade is just another reason for him to be in
       the goat category.

       Peyton, Rodgers and Brady have all endured very tough losses, it’s
       the nature of the game to have highs and lows.
       But all three have consistently shown great class in adversity.
       Cam will never be in the same class as those three.
       ——
       I think you can add Russell Wilson to that list already after 4
       years he has gone to back to back Super Bowls and won one of them
       in dominating fashion and lost the other in crushing fashion but
       was absolutely class all the way after both. Russell Wilson
       couldn’t wait to get back at it. After listening to his postgame
       press search all Seahawk fans are excited about the next
       opportunity.
       Meanwhile there is cam sitting under his towel.
       Richard Sherman and Russell Wilson and the rest of the Seahawks
       were very impressed with Peyton Manning coming to their locker room
       to congratulate them after the game a couple of years ago after
       getting his butt whooped. I think that left an impression on all of
       them. It’s how the game should be played.

       The Carolina Panthers are the most polite team in pro football. Oh

       return by tackling you. Please proceed. Oh Mr. Football I would
       hate to see your lovely shape deformed by me jumping on you says

       Great player with a breakout season.
       That said, I personally don’t like the showboating from Cam and the
       Panthers. I don’t mind some celebration, but they take it to the
       point it seems like they are showing up the other team. Taking
       sideline photos during a game is a JV move.
       Hiding in a hoodie, giving 1 and 2 words answers for 2 minutes and
       then walking out is childish. If you want to be over the top in
       celebrating when you win, then try to lose with a little bit of
       class.
       Oh yeah, Carson Palmer went 23/40 (58%) for 235 yards with 1 TD and
       4 INTs. Cam went 18/41 (44%) for 265 yards with 0 TD, 1 INT and 2
       fumbles. Is Cam a choker as well????

       Wow, listen to ALL of these weak minded anti-Cam commenters. Your
       jealousy is so apparent and sad. We get it, you hate that he will
       be a dominant QB for years to cone, that he challenges your view of
       how he should act because he reminds you of how weak you are at
       life in comparison to him. He out played old Peyton and if it
       wasn’t for the Denver D, this would have been a different game. So
       go ahead and have your moment old school haters. Cam and players
       like him are the future and Peyton and his God (Budweiser) can go
       off as the new Trent Dilfer who got lucky to win behind a good D. I
       congratulate the Broncos, but the rest of you commenting idiots can
       just shut up, you don’t have an ounce of the skill, character, or
       talent that Cam has. You all are just internet scum bags. I’m not
       even a Panthers fan, I just hate to see weak clowns judging someone
       who is WAY above them in all aspects of life.
   147. [173]Gridiron Ghost says: Feb 8, 2016 12:35 AM
       This is what Cam Newton is all about. It’s all about him. Part of
       being great is losing well, and holding your head high even after
       the most brutal of defeats. Cam is just a big kid. All of that talk
       about how he’s matured is out the window now. He showboats when he
       wins and behaves like a spoiled brat when he loses. You would never
       see Peyton Manning or Tom Brady behave like this.
   148. [174]namriverrat69 says: Feb 8, 2016 12:37 AM
       When Cam Newton is winning he continually rubs it in the face of
       the opposing team by his arrogant actions and dabbing. How is that
       good sportsmanship? I say again, he just loves to rub it in. Real
       men don’t act like that.
       Losing, instead of sitting on the bench studying defenses to work
       on winning, he pouts and like the pouter poster child, Vince Young,
       puts a towel over his head like, if he can’t see the game’s going
       south, it isn’t really happening. He is a big immature cry baby.
       Winners are gracious in winning and gracious in losing. Cam Newton
       is a gloating winner and a cry baby loser. That is not a leader of
       men. When I followed a leader into battle he was nothing like Cam
       Newton. The only thing Cam Newton would excel leading is a panty
       raid.

       tonight and instead of smiling and entertaining and being an icon,
       Newton acted like a fool in post game press conference.
       It’s much more telling to see how a man handles adversity than how
       he handles winning all the time.

       Jacksonville produced this season.
       *GASP* you guys mean a dual threat QB who won 16/17 games he played
       was visibly happier during the wins than during a Super Bowl loss
       where he spent most of the evening getting hit or running for his
       life?
       You mean to tell me that a professional athlete had a different

       One thing that I have not seen anyone comment on is this: why is it
       that, after watching espn for 2 hours after the game, I finally had
       to get on HERE to even find out what Cam’s reaction was??? I hate
       espn and do not watch that network or listen to any of their
       jackass radio personalities, so I honestly do not know the answer
       to this question, but is it that espn is all over Cam’s jock and
       just decided to pretend that his petulant behavior in the presser
       never happened?
       That’s just further confirmation for me that espn is an absolute
       joke.
       As for Cam, I totally respect his ability but was really
       disappointed to see his body language during the game and and of
       course reading on here about how he behaved afterward. He needs to
       grow up for sure.

       Another of Cam’s big fumbles was swept under the rug. He was
       running up the middle, got hit by a tackler, and then a 2nd guy
       before he was down, and the ball popped out. A Bronco recovered and
       was taking off with the ball. The ref had blown the whistle, ending
       the play prematurely. To add insult to injury, the refs claimed
       that Cam was down and it was a late hit, giving Carolina 15 yards
       and a first down. I got suspicious after that play, and was
       concerned the fix was in. Luckily, Cam played so bad that the game
       couldn’t be salvaged for the Panthers.

       no chance to win (I actually wondered why in the world they were
       even showing up as the media had Cam and the Panthers beating them
       by at least 21 points!) I really didn’t think that was going to
       happen. I DO believe defenses win championships. I know how
       intelligent Peyton is. I felt bad for Cam. He will learn from this.
       I wish he would have handled this loss better. This will not be his
       last SB. Keep smiling, Cam, it will get better.

       If he recovers that ball, it’s Possession: Panthers in a 6-point

       to be in that situation. Instead, he throws his hands in the air
       like a little girl, backs away, and a moment later it’s a 14-point
       game.

       Of Course Cam’s upset. Whoever loses the SB will be upset. That’s
       expected, not a surprise.
       AND of course we could see that this game was a LOT more than a Cam
       problem… especially against such an amazing Broncos defense.
       BUT. What many people here don’t get, and it has NOTHING to do with
       whether I could do what Cam has done. (My job is to be a fan.) HIS
       job is to be a classy leader. A leader who is in it to the last
       second. He even talked about it in a pregame interview. How he
       wants to be the best in every aspect of the game…
       Cam, every single game has a loser. Time to learn how to lose well.
       Lose classy. Lose like a leader. Be there for and with your team.
       You have a long career ahead of you, or at least you could.
       Never Burn Your Bridges. You’re going to look back on this attitude

       answer moronic media questions 30-60 mins after?
       I understand they are professionals and all but come on…they are
       not robots so don’t expect them to be able to mask their emotions
       so soon after losing what is usually the biggest game (seeing as
       most don’t get to multiple superbowls) of most careers.

       If you don’t like all these negative comments, maybe you should
       have won the Big Game ™…

       It’s the last game of the season, you’ve got @ least 6 months to
       recover if you’re injured. YOU DIVE FOR THE BALL!!!!

       At least we don’t have to hear Deion Sanders’ mancrush song “Cam,
       oh Cam” for a while
   201. [209]dw00j says: Feb 8, 2016 8:03 AM
       Cam just seems to be a product of what people have done to many
       gifted athletes since they emerged as kids. Set up for failure when
       things don’t go their way. He is bewildered and appears to have no
       concept of personal responsibility. But the great thing is that he
       has superior physical talent. All he needs is to grow up and become
       a man… leave all that ‘look-at-me’ B.S. behind. Otherwise, he’s
       just another one who peaked early.
   202. tim2200 says: Feb 8, 2016 8:03 AM
       America saw the real Cam Newton in that press conference.
       Now compare his presser performance with that from a year earlier
       with Russell Wilson answering questions about a Super Bowl losing
       INT.
       Grow up Fig!
       And act like a professional……for a change.
   203. [210]shoeflypie says: Feb 8, 2016 8:21 AM
       Lots of folks on here protecting Cam’s response by saying “How
       would you feel if you lost? I wouldn’t want a good loser on my
       team.” That is the thrust of their comments. I guess my take on
       this is, “Yes, it is tough to lose. Not everyone can be or should
       be a good loser. However, I think we would like to see a GRACIOUS
       loser.” Cam isn’t. Yet. Maybe someday.
   204. [211]stlbirds21 says: Feb 8, 2016 8:21 AM
       Everyone who slams cam newton needs to calm down. None of us know
       what it’s like to lose a Super Bowl. I’m sure not every person who
       commented on here would hold the exact same press conference if
       they lost the big game. Lets interview you when you get passed on a
       promotion and see how you would feel.
   205. bl00dwerk says: Feb 8, 2016 8:21 AM
       Here’s hoping he never makes it back…
   206. RegisHawk says: Feb 8, 2016 8:24 AM
       Hey, it’s not easy being the first QB in the history of ever to
       lose the Super Bowl…
       /sarcasm
   207. [212]johnnyballsack says: Feb 8, 2016 8:32 AM
       Anyone who comes out in warm ups wearing Gold shoes with MVP
       written on them has to know that Karma is going to smack him in the
       face!
   208. [213]attilatheplumber says: Feb 8, 2016 8:40 AM
       Great game, first of all. I loved every play, really.
       And I am no Cam Newton critic usually, but that failure to go after
       the ball would be a telling comment about any player, and
       especially for one like Newton.
       He gave up, period. He quit.
       We all saw it in real time.
       If it was a lineman or a defensive player or a running back, they’d
       be on the trading block today.
       May be forgive a kicker. But, then again, maybe we don’t.
   209. bulldogmomanne says: Feb 8, 2016 8:42 AM
       Peyton is not humble. He loves attention as much or more than
       anyone. He has simply learned and been coached on how to mask his
       ego when being interviewed. BTW, doesn’t Tracy Wolfson sound
       exactly like the AFLAC duck?
   210. [214]behaviorquest says: Feb 8, 2016 8:44 AM
       This was classic. A wounded narcissist having to confront reality.
       So tough for pretty boy.
   211. [215]rw3sluxuriouscurls says: Feb 8, 2016 8:45 AM
       Media SHAM Newton. Those Band-Aids for feelings would come in
       pretty handy now huh? What a Widdle Baby he is when him don’t get
       his way. Dab!!!Lolololololol
   212. [216]gohawks7 says: Feb 8, 2016 8:56 AM
       What a twat. Last year Wilson had his heart ripped out of his chest
       at the end of the game and was gracious to the media afterward.
       Sorry, Cam…you’ll never be that great. Good luck next year when you
       don’t have to play the easiest schedule in the league.
   213. [217]throwingstones20 says: Feb 8, 2016 8:57 AM
       Not very MVP-ish. Grow up. You lost sit there and answer questions.
       The G-O-A-T would never walk off the podium. Win with class lose
       with class. Take some lessons TB12
   214. [218]rex2020 says: Feb 8, 2016 8:57 AM
       Society needed this. Agreed! Cam has a huge amount of talent but
       it’s how you behave and react when things don’t go your way. If you
       want to be thought of like the legends and the greats…..WIN
       something. Then win again. Then talk! Everybody is the next Brady
       next Montana.
       I’m from Chicago and for years I’ve had to hear this is the new
       Jordan or he is better. Just like Cam. WIN! Then talk. And PLEASE
       stop with the racial BS. Just because someone criticizes you why is
       it always about race?! Maybe it’s your behavior and someone proved
       it last night when things didn’t go my way…..wha wah
   215. [219]bigblue431 says: Feb 8, 2016 8:58 AM
       His demeanor during and after the game, when suffering a big loss,
       is why people don’t like Cam.
       Has nothing to do with race.
       It’s that Cam and the Panthers are bullies and sore losers who like
       to rub their opponent’s nose in their defeats. But the moment the
       tide turns on them, they become petulant cry-babies. Cam is the
       worst of them.
       You can’t run around dabbin’ with your cape and not expect people
       to be critical when you cry when things don’t go your way.
   216. [220]Mike Oviatt says: Feb 8, 2016 9:11 AM
       For all the mouth running he did that people are scared of him he
       showed he’s just a punk.
   217. paul1990 says: Feb 8, 2016 9:14 AM
       Glad I wasn’t the only one put off by last nights press conference.
       As I was watching, I was pissed he had that damn hood up and giving
       one word answers. He needs to be a man….put your hood down and
       answer the questions. Greg Olsen did that….that’s how you handle a
       tough situation. What a spoiled brat!

       You can’t Dab and take team pictures during a win then pull this
       crap. Gotta take it like a man. I heard the reporter asked “Are you
       wearing your Superman shirt under the hoodie?”
       _____
       Exactly why he didn’t want to stay. People like you call Cam every
       negative word you can think of just for doing the same antics that
       have been done on NFL fields for nearly 100 years, but Cam is evil
       for doing them, and the reporters know that people like you want
       them to ask stupid questions like that.
       Like I said, Cam has done nothing that hasn’t been going on in NFL
       games since the birth of the game, but people like you have
       insisted Cam is the most evil man to ever walk the Earth for it.
       And he’s been hearing this crap since 2010. Hearing BS like this
       every minute of every day for 5 years has to get to you at some
       point. I’m sure if anyone wanted to ask questions about the game,
       he would have stayed. But with BS questions like that, it’s not
       surprising he walked out.
   219. bubbahotepp says: Feb 8, 2016 9:51 AM
       He must be studying at the Bill Belicheat school of sore losing.
   220. wahoo21 says: Feb 8, 2016 10:06 AM
       Cam just flat out blew it on many levels but the one that hurts him
       the most is that he THINKS he is great yet he will be like so many
       other great QBs that never got back to the Superbowl……he won’t make
       it back
       He got his chance to be on the biggest stage in sport and he played
       terrible and will be forever remembered for his front runner
       attitude and the press is unforgiving and they don’t forget.
       Congrats Cam…..you’re legacy is now set in stone.
   221. [221]mack2x says: Feb 8, 2016 10:29 AM
       Now you see the reason people dislike this guy, not for the trumped
       up reasons you heard before the game.
   222. cfos00 says: Feb 8, 2016 10:36 AM
       Sports don’t build character. They reveal it. And Cam just showed
       exactly what kind of character he has. It’s easy to be a leader
       when things are going well. It’s when they aren’t that you’re
       tested. Well, he was tested today, and failed miserably.
   223. [222]attilatheplumber says: Feb 8, 2016 10:45 AM
       Is Cam the Donald Trump of quarterbacks?
   224. sn19 says: Feb 8, 2016 10:46 AM
       If he had just stuck around after the game in the presser and said
       something to the effect of “I don’t know what happened. I thought
       it was a forward pass, so I didn’t react. I should have done
       better,” 75% of these comments would be turned around, and the
       narrative would be different this morning.
       As it is, he didn’t. Because it’s simply not who he is.
       Cam has a long – LONG way to go if he wants to be mentioned in the
       same sentence as Russell Wilson, let alone Tom Brady and Peyton
       Manning. At this point, I think I’d rather have Teddy Bridgewater.
   225. [223]deneb1973 says: Feb 8, 2016 11:05 AM
       The NFL might want to rethink having a pouting Cam Newton as the
       new face of the NFL unless the image it wants is a grown man who
       rolls on the sideline in frustration; a hoodie clad sullen child
       responding petulantly to questions; a “superman” who refused to
       contest recovery of his own fumble. If this is the new NFL I’m glad
       basketball is in season and baseball spring training is about to
       start.
   226. breadmeatcheese says: Feb 8, 2016 11:09 AM
       I could care less about Cam Newton falling on a ball or answering
       questions about comic book character analogies.
       I disliked Cam Newton when he used a nationally televised
       commercial to Defend Josh Norman’s Bigotry.

   229. orcahawk says: Feb 8, 2016 12:02 PM
       2 years ago Peyton Manning took questions after his SB loss, and
       handled it with class. Last year Wilson and Sherman took questions
       after their SB loss and handled it with class. This year…? Um not
       so much on the class thing.

   231. [226]attilatheplumber says: Feb 8, 2016 12:33 PM
       Newton is no villain, but he’s no hero either.
       He’s a kid, a great talent and too much in his own head for his own
       good.
       The most memorable moment of Super Bowl 50: Cam Newton looking
       right at that fumbled ball on the ground and deciding to do
       nothing.
       He will be a LONG time living that one down.
       If they’ll make a poster of it, I’ll buy one.
   232. Central Cali Chiefs says: Feb 8, 2016 1:26 PM
       ESPN and other media outlets made it a racial thing.
       Cam is Cam, a frontrunner who hogs the spotlight when the goings
       are good, but pouts and shrinks when he’s a loser.
       It happens; (losing), just show some class and maturity when it
       does.
       Not a race thing why Cam is disliked. Cam is an egomaniac. Cam
       loves when people bow to him, yet when he is challenged and
       defeated, he cowards away.
   233. [227]lambeaudungbarn says: Feb 8, 2016 1:44 PM
       I wonder how long it will be before he starts blaming the Refs, and
       calls/non calls, on the game results?
   234. [228]borderline1988 says: Feb 8, 2016 3:31 PM
       Lack of class is one thing. But not diving on the football is
       inexcusable. Maybe he just had a brain fart at that moment and it
       wasn’t about toughness. But still an inexcusable play for a team
       leader. If it was a fringe player who pulled a stunt like that in
       such a critical moment, he would be cut and probably never play
       another game in the NFL.
   235. [229]gohawks7 says: Feb 8, 2016 4:12 PM
       Another reason why I’m proud to have Russell Wilson be the QB of
       the team I love.

       If Cam Newton is Superman, then Peyton Manning is Doomsday.. AKA
       (The Death of Superman issue).
       Typical reaction from the generation of Riot if you don’t get your
       way!
       I’m surprised there isn’t rioting for the incomplete pass and the
       end zone personal foul no call.
   238. [231]PFT's Most Censored says: Feb 9, 2016 7:53 AM
       This is the same guy that got kicked out of one college for
       stealing an exam paper and only changing the name, exploited the
       system to receive booster money to his dad’s church to talk have
       colleges talk to him and the same guy that was accused of stealing
       computers from campus. When the cops came to question him, they
       found the computers outside his window.
       What did you expect? This is the real Cam Newtown.
       Keep It Classy Cam!
