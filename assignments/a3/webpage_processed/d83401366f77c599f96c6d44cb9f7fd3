Features to Consider When Choosing the Best Weight Bench for Home:

   Most workout benches are designed to handle the lifter along with the
   weights that they are working with. They are basically flat with a
   padded seat base that serves as a cushion for the user. Most models are
   made from tubular steel tubes, which are bolted or welded on the
   conjoining seams. On the other hand, there are some models that have a
   more elaborate features such as an inclining backrest and fully
   adjustable seat base which provides different seating angles that
   offers a variety of resistance to efficiently develop the muscles in
   your abdomen, chest and arms. Some products also feature an attachable
   [25]leg workout mechanism that can be bought as a separate add-on
   component to your existing workout bench. However, there are weight
   lifting benches that already come with these features which can really
   give you a complete upper body and leg workout. This makes
   upgradeability another important factor to consider, since you do not
   want to get a workout equipment that offers you as many different
   training options as possible. After market service and parts are very
   important to make sure that the brand you choose has parts that are
   available after your warranty has lapsed. Comfort and stability is also
   as important as not everybody has the same type of body features with
   regard to size and height. Always determine if you will be able to
   comfortably reach certain segments of the workout bench and if you feel
   comfortable when you sit on it (This shouldn’t be a big problem unless
   you are extremely tall or short). Determine whether the seats are fully
   adjustable to be able to give you a variety of seating positions. The
   quality of the seat cushion and the durability of the upholstery is
   also essential. Make a detailed inspection of the way the steel tubes
   are put together, especially on the conjoining seams to determine the
   strength of the entire weight bench. Whether that be for daily exercise
   or just a means of keeping your body toned, you should always decide on
   the [26]type of workouts you plan to do. If you should have any issues
   regarding minor back and muscle conditions, but still wanting to get a
   workout bench to use in your home, it is ideal to consult a doctor or
   physical trainer before buying one. Here are some different types  that
   can give you a variety of different workout methods which targets
   certain muscle groups on the body, particularly the arms, abdominals
   and the legs. Each type may vary in design as each may have features
   that differ from one another. Check out our short descriptions of the
   different options out there to find the perfect one for you.

Types of Home Weightlifting and Workout Benches:


[27]Biceps training bench Preacher Curl Bench:

   Pump it like Arnold! This type is used to develop the biceps and was
   one of Arnold Schwarzeneggers favorite exercises! There is a cushioned
   arm pad that is used to dampen the pressure exerted on the elbows as
   you lift. Its foundation is very stable since the of the user is
   sitting on it and pushing it down, keeping it balanced under any
   circumstances. Having a 30 degree sloping angle, a preacher curl bench
   is usually small enough to fit in most places, which is very ideal for
   personal home use.

   of dumbbells more convenient compared to performing exercises standing
   up. This type usually has an adjustable seat base along with a fully
   functional inclining backrest which can be configured to any desired
   angle to fit the purpose of your work out. Most dumbbell models have
   fixed horizontal seats, while others have ready built segments that can
   be used to attach other add-ons such as a preacher curl or even a leg
   workout extender, which is usually bought separately.

[30]Olympic Weight Bench [31]The Best Olympic Weight Benches:

   Olympic workout benches are more elaborately constructed compared to
   other products types as they are built with heavy gauge steel tubes.
   This is necessary since [32]Olympic benches not only support the the
   user sitting on it, but also have to accommodate the weight of the
   barbells that are usually placed on the bar holders above the seat. The
   seat and backrest are usually adjustable to give you the convenience of
   adjusting your preferred height and inclination angle. Since the safety
   of the lifter is important, stability is essential to make to make sure
   the athlete has full control at all times. Some products also come with
   a leg workout extender that provides users with a complete, full body
   training which is the closest thing that you can have to that of having
   your own personal home gym.
