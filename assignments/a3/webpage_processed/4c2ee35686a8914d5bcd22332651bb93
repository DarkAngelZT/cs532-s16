   Why are relationships so hard today? Why do we fail at love every time,
   despite trying so hard? Why have humans suddenly become so inept at
   making relationships last? Have we forgotten how to love? Or worse,
   forgotten what love is?

   We’re not prepared. We’re not prepared for the sacrifices, for the
   compromises, for the unconditional love. We’re not ready to invest all
   that it takes to make a relationship work. We want everything easy.
   We’re quitters. All it takes is a single hurdle to make us crumble to
   our feet. We don’t let our love grow, we let go before time.

   It’s not love we’re looking for, only excitement and thrill in life. We
   want someone to watch movies and party with, not someone who
   understands us even in our deepest silences. We spend time together, we
   don’t make memories. We don’t want the boring life. We don’t want a
   partner for life, just someone who can make us feel alive right now,
   this very instant. When the excitement fades, we discover nobody ever
   prepared us for the mundane. We don’t believe in the beauty of
   predictability because we’re too blinded by the thrill of adventure.

   We immerse ourselves in the inconsequentials of the city life, leaving
   no space for love. We don’t have time to love, we don’t have the
   patience to deal with relationships. We’re busy people chasing
   materialistic dreams and there’s no scope to love. Relationships are
   nothing more than convenience.

   We look for instant gratification in everything we do – the things we
   post online, the careers we choose, and the people we fall in love
   with. We want the maturity in a relationship that comes with time, the
   emotional connect that develops over years, that sense of belonging
   when we barely even know the other person. Apparently, nothing’s worth
   our time and patience – not even love.

   We’d rather spend an hour each with a hundred people than spending a
   day with one. We believe in having ‘options’. We’re ‘social’ people. We
   believe more in meeting people than getting to know them. We’re greedy.
   We want to have everything. We get into relationships at the slightest
   attraction and step out, the moment we find someone better. We don’t
   want to bring out the best in that one person. We want them to be
   perfect. We date a lot of people but rarely give any of them a real
   chance. We’re disappointed in everyone.

   Technology has brought us closer, so close that it’s impossible to
   breathe. Our physical presence has been replaced by texts, voice
   messages, snapchats and video calls. We don’t feel the need to spend
   time together anymore. We have too much of each other already. There’s
   nothing left to talk about.

   We’re a generation of ‘wanderers’ who wouldn’t stay at one place for
   too long. Everyone is commitment phobic. We believe we’re not meant for
   relationships. We don’t want to settle down. Even the thought of it is
   scary. We cannot imagine being with one person for the rest of our
   lives. We walk away. We despise permanence like its some social evil.
   We like to believe we’re ‘different’ than the rest. We like to believe
   we don’t conform to social norms.

   We’re a generation that calls itself ‘sexually liberated’. We can tell
   sex apart from love, or so we think. We’re the hook-up-break-up
   generation. We have sex first and then decide if we want to love
   someone. Sex comes easy, loyalty doesn’t. Getting laid has become the
   new getting drunk. You do it not because you love the other person, but
   because you want to feel good. It’s all the temporary fulfillment we
   need. Sex outside relationships isn’t a taboo anymore. Relationships
   aren’t that simple anymore. There are open relationships, friends with
   benefits, causal flings, one-night stands, no strings attached – we’ve
   left very little exclusivity for love in our lives.

   We’re the practical generation who runs by logic alone. We don’t know
   how to love madly anymore. We wouldn’t take a flight to a far-off land
   just to see someone we love. We’d break up because, long distance.
   We’re too sensible for love. Too sensible for our own good.

   © Thinkstock Photos/Getty Images © Thinkstock Photos/Getty Images

   We’re a scared generation – scared to fall in love, scared to commit,
   scared to fall, scared to get hurt, scared to get our hearts broken. We
   don’t allow anyone in, nor do we step out and love anyone
   unconditionally. We lurk from behind walls we’ve created ourselves,
   looking for love and running away the moment we really find it. We
   suddenly ‘cannot handle it’. We don’t want to be vulnerable. We don’t
   want to bare our soul to anyone. We’re too guarded.

   Why Modern Relationships Never Last © Thinkstock Photos/Getty Images

   We don’t even value relationships anymore. We let go of the most
   wonderful people for ‘the other fishes in the sea.’ We don’t consider
   them sacred anymore.

   There’s nothing we couldn’t conquer in this world, and yet, here we are
   ham-fisted at the game of love – the most basic of human instincts.
   Evolution, they call it.
