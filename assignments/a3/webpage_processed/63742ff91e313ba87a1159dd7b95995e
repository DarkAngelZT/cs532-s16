Should fitness for the Oval Office be judged on medical records?

   Scott Gottlieb and Whitt Flora take opposing views.
   Scott Gottlieb and Whitt Flora
   Posted on Feb. 8, 2016 at 12:00 a.m.

   Two writers respond to the question, “Should presidential candidates be
   required to release complete and certified medical records?”

   Medical results shouldn’t be a big factor, by Scott Gottlieb

   Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are both almost 70.

   Each has accumulated some of the medical risk that comes with advancing
   age. But their fitness for office shouldn’t inevitably follow from
   their age or accumulated health problems.

   Historically, there’s been a political presumption that clinical
   history and older age are legitimate factors in assessing fitness for
   office. Such thinking represents an outdated view of health and the
   practice of medicine.

   President Barack Obama’s political team lost no chance to exploit Sen.
   John McCain’s age as a factor in the 2008 presidential race. McCain
   would have been 72 when he was first sworn into the office.

   Clinton is 68 and Trump is 69. Clinton suffered a well-publicized head
   injury while secretary of state. Trump has noted his poor eating
   habits. Each has had reference made to their struggles with weight.

   It’s true that, in the case of Trump and Clinton, their age alone puts
   them at higher risk for a litany of medical conditions.

   Yet older age, and even a history of medical insults, shouldn’t be a
   big factor in how voters judge candidates for the presidency so long as
   these influences aren’t already revealed to limit their current
   capacities.

   Episodes of illness and chronic ailments put a person at higher risk
   for future problems. But the inverse isn’t unavoidably true. Just
   because someone is at an elevated risk for a bad medical outcome
   doesn’t impact his or her present fitness.

   Medical advances and healthier living are pushing out the boundaries
   not only of life expectancy, but also of the ability of people to
   remain more vital and active far longer into their later years.

   Today, the impact of health conditions like heart disease is made far
   more manageable by modern drugs and medical devices. Better diagnostic
   tests and close medical supervision, of the sort afforded to our
   president, have made early diagnosis a key factor in curing diseases
   like cancer.

   Recent presidents have faced medical problems with little impact on
   their duties to the office.

   Ronald Reagan was diagnosed with a form of early colon cancer while in
   office, requiring removal of part of his colon. President George H.W.
   Bush had atrial fibrillation and hyperthyroidism. Bill Clinton
   underwent quadruple bypass surgery for treatment of advanced heart
   disease less than four years after leaving office.

   The benefits offered by modern medicine affords us the opportunity to
   draw a sharp distinction between a medical history that creates
   clinical risk and one that impairs a person’s current mental and
   physical fitness.

   Based on what’s known so far about the health profile of all the
   leading candidates for the presidency, some have conditions that could
   increase their risk for a future health problem. But none have a
   medical profile that should impair their fitness for the office or slow
   them down.

   The kinds of things that put people at risk in the past are being
   solved by technology. In a study of men born before 1913, the top risk
   factor for death from stroke was high blood pressure.

   Today, with hypertension better treated by an armamentarium of highly
   effective drugs, smoking is becoming the leading factor. Cancer deaths
   are falling as more people are diagnosed earlier and cured by targeted
   drugs that put them at far less risk for future cancers and health
   problems.

   Many people have struggled through a medical hardship. Almost all of us
   eventually will. Those who have, bear witness to the indecencies of
   illness as well as the humility and strength that comes with
   persevering.

   That struggle can be as much of a qualification for major office as a
   health condition was, at one time, an exclusion.

   Scott Gottlieb is a practicing physician who has served in various
   capacities at the Food and Drug Administration, including senior
   adviser for medical technology. Readers may write him at AEI, 1150 17th
   Street NW, Washington, DC 20036.

   Medical records matter to the public, by Whitt Flora

   With a septuagenarian and soon-to-be septuagenarian contending for the
   Democratic nomination and a 69-year-old man with admitted weight
   problems leading the GOP field, one can only wonder why the nation’s
   press corps hasn’t zeroed in on the health of presidential candidates.

   Surely a candidate’s physical and mental fitness to survive the
   pressure cooker of the presidency in this era of global turmoil should
   be a pressing concern of American voters this fall.

   Sen. Bernie Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist from
   Vermont, will be 75 when voters go to the polls in November. He was
   born on Sept. 8, 1941 — just months before Japan’s infamous attack on
   Pearl Harbor.

   Sanders had hernia repair surgery in November, but other than that,
   appears to have a clean medical slate. He may well be the second coming
   of Jack LaLanne, the godfather of physical fitness, but a complete
   certified medical report might be more reassuring to voters.

   His main opponent, Hillary Clinton, has a recent history of falling
   down on the job — literally. She has fainted four times since 1998 —
   twice while serving as a U.S. senator from New York and two more times
   in her later stint as secretary of state.

   The last episode, which reportedly occurred at the Clinton mansion just
   off Washington’s Embassy Row in December 2012, was the most serious —
   causing a concussion and clotting on the brain. She returned to work
   the next month.

   The personal physicians of Clinton and Sanders released one-page
   letters in late January attesting to their patients’ good health, but
   Hillary’s made no mention of her fainting spells.

   On the GOP side, Donald Trump appears reasonably healthy and is
   enjoying himself on the stump, but he’s older than Clinton and has
   waged an off-and-on battle with his weight.

   Other top Republican candidates, while considerably younger than
   Sanders, Clinton and Trump, may have lurking medical ailments not
   apparent to the naked eye.

   Without a chance to peruse the complete and certified medical reports
   of GOP front-runners like Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, voters will go to
   the polls without a body of vital knowledge that would help them make a
   truly informed decision.

   Consider the case of Woodrow Wilson, who led the nation through World
   War I only to suffer an incapacitating stroke at, perhaps, the most
   crucial moment of his presidency.

   Wilson successfully persuaded the major European powers to back his
   vision for a League of Nations by including it in the Versailles
   Treaty. Returning home he was unable to convince conservative senators,
   who blocked ratification of the treaty.

   A fervent believer in a global body to mediate and solve disputes
   between nations, Wilson decided to bypass the Senate and — against the
   advice of his personal physician — take his case to the people with a
   cross-country train tour.

   Wilson began the tour — 8,000 miles in 22 days — on Sept. 3, 1919. The
   grueling schedule cost the president his health and ultimately his
   life.

   During the tour, Wilson began to suffer pervasive headaches and in late
   September collapsed from exhaustion in Pueblo, Colo. He was rushed back
   to the nation’s capital, but suffered a near-fatal stroke on Oct. 2
   that left his left side paralyzed and impaired his vision.

   His wife Edith summoned his personal physician and the two decided to
   keep his condition from the American people.

   For the last 17 months of Wilson’s presidency all communications went
   through his wife, who entered his sick room and came out with verbal
   instructions or written orders with an often illegible scrawl on the
   line awaiting his signature.

   Without Wilson’s driving force, America rejected joining the League of
   Nations, an action which many historians believe set the stage for
   World War II.

   Wilson’s illness shows why it’s so crucial that American voters have
   complete and unfiltered access to candidates’ medical records before
   they go the polls.
