Find locations on a blind map!

   A blind map is a map without borders, city names, roads and trains.
   Just pure nature: mountains, coasts, great plains, forrests or just
   deserts. Can you find a given location on such a blind map?

   Do you know whether a city like [24]Larnaca is located on a coast or in
   the mountains? Rather in the north or on the west coast? In Europe or
   Africa? All these questions lead to this geography game - find a
   location on a blind map only by name and some sightseeing highlights!

Are you better than the other players?

   Check our statistics to see, which locations were found by others
   better than by you. Or maybe you set the record for a single location?
