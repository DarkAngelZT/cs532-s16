   Fitness expert attacks heart health with exercise

   CHICO, Calif. -

   February is Heart Health Awareness month. One of the many ways to
   prevent heart disease is through exercise. The American Heart
   Association recommends a workout regimen for overall cardiovascular
   health. A personal trainer broke down how to accomplish that regimen.

   For overall cardiovascular health, the AHA recommends at least 30
   minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity at least five days per
   week.

   Personal trainer and Co-Owner of Advanced Body Dynamics, Jeff Katz,
   said that you can exercise at that intensity in different ways. Squats
   and walking are two examples.

   "Moderate is something that is going to get your heart rate up and push
   your body," said Katz. " But it's not over the limit to where your
   going to get sick."

   Another plan AHA recommends for overall heart health is at least 25
   minutes of vigorous aerobic activity at least three days per week,
   along with moderate-to-high-intensity muscle strengthening activity at
   least two days per week.

   Katz explained that a vigorous workout could be accomplished by doing
   "mountain climbers". Muscle-strengthening can be done with curls.

   Katz said that his [74]personal training classes can help people of all
   ages regain or build heart heath.

   Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the world.
