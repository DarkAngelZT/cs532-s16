   New venue at Disneyʼs ESPN sports complex will focus on cheerleading

   Walt Disney World's [6]ESPN Wide World of Sports says the new venue
   it's planning will host cheerleading and dance team competitions.

   Disney submitted plans for the new 286,000-square-foot facility to the
   state last month but did not specify then what it would be used for.

   Disney says the building will be the world's first venue specifically
   for cheerleading and dance. Construction will begin this month with
   completion scheduled for mid-2017. Disney is teaming with the
   cheerleading organization Varsity Spirit to create the space.

   The building "will include a flexible design for one large competition
   space that can be set up for as many as four competition areas," Disney
   said in a press release.

   There will also be areas tailored for warm-up and practice.

   With seating for more than 8,000 people, the new multi-use building
   could also host six regulation basketball courts, six regulation
   volleyball courts, or concerts.

   The resort currently hosts cheerleading competitions in other venues at
   its sports complex and at Disney's Hollywood Studios. The new space
   will allow Disney to bring in more competitions as the sport grows.

   The new facility "will be a model for cheerleading and dance team
   competitions," Maribeth Bisienere, senior vice president of ESPN Wide
   World of Sports, said in a press release. "We value our young athletes
   and want to give these incredible guests an experience that can only be
   achieved at Disney."
