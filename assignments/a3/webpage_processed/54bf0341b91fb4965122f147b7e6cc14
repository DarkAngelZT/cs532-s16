   MANCHESTER—The Ted Cruz campaign is optimistic that it will shake up
   expectations on New Hampshire’s primary Tuesday.

   The Real Clear polling average for the New Hampshire GOP primary shows
   Cruz in third place with 12 percent, while Marco Rubio is in second and
   has 16 percent. Trump leads the pack with 30.7 percent.

   Former New Hampshire Republican Sen. Bob Smith, a Cruz campaign ally,
   expressed full confidence about the campaign’s ground game overcoming
   present poll expectations.

   “I’m not knocking polls. They were wrong in my case in 1996, when they
   said that I lost. I think what we’ve been doing is knocking on doors,”
   Smith told The Daily Caller. “We’ve been ID’ing voters who are leaners,
   people who are not sure, and we’ve been knocking on thousands and
   thousands of doors for literally months and I’ll tell you it feels good
   out there.”

   Smith says it is a tradition in New Hampshire to be on the ground and
   meet people. “And that’s what Cruz has been doing now for several
   weeks. I’ve been on the bus with him all this week and a week or so a
   go, he was up for another five-day bus trip,” he said.

   “He was meeting two three four hundred people one night. 1300 people at
   stop after stop after stop. So he’s met thousands of voters here one on
   one,” said Smith.

   “And then when you go to these meetings or these rallies, it’s not
   Donald Trump with 5,000 people, but I would rather meet 5,000 in 15 or
   20 stops where you get to interact than 5,000 people that you’re
   speaking to,” he explained. “It’s different It’s the interaction people
   like here, which is why the term rubber stamp is so appropriate here.”

   Cruz surrogate Steve Lonegan, a New Jersey Republican activist, agreed
   with Smith telling TheDC Saturday night, “It’s over a 100 people right
   now. I think we have more than any other candidate. Our headquarter
   phones are going non-stop. We’re setting up 40 satellite offices in
   people’s homes and around the state for election day to get out the
   vote. So this campaign is superb about building a grassroots movement
   and so we will outperform people’s expectations.”

   The Cruz campaign’s volunteers include college students who often stay
   at the dormitories of Chester College, a now-closed school.

   “I came up this Friday but I was up a couple of weekends ago, so I’m
   going to stay here until the primary,” said Kareena, a 19-year old
   student at the University of Rhode Island.

   Kareena, like many of the students working on the campaign, are phone
   banking and door knocking for the first time on a political campaign.

   “A lot of people are receptive to what we have to say and even if
   they’re not they’re really respectful. People in New Hampshire—I think
   they’re used to all these phone calls, so they know how to handle it. A
   lot of people are very receptive, which is great for us,” she said.

   Kareena explained, “I usually just ask them if they’re interested in
   Ted Cruz and, if so, if they plan on voting for him. I ask them, if
   there is any political matter or any issues that has come up in the
   media that they would like me to answer for them or get someone else in
   the campaign to answer for them and usually they ask a few questions
   about policy matters and I try my best to answer and I direct them to
   the website if they want anymore information.”

   Additionally, during door knocks, volunteers use a smart phone app
   called I-360. The application, Kareena says, is targeted to independent
   voters and people interested in Cruz.

   “We go door to door, and we have walk books for different cities in New
   Hampshire, so it’s really great. It’s incredible. You don’t have to
   carry around a bunch of papers and clip boards. So it’s really
   convenient,” she said.

   Fellow Cruz volunteer Mary Brown, an 18-year-old from the University of
   Tulsa, also enjoys door knocks.

   “It’s fun to see the different areas of New Hampshire. It’s kind of
   like phone banking. You get a lot of different answers. It’s kind of
   really exciting when you see someone with a Ted Cruz sign or ted Cruz
   sticker,” she says.

   Sen. Smith lauded the door knocking operation the Cruz campaign put
   together in the Granite State.

   “I feel very confident based on the ground game—the resources we have,
   the money we have. We have one of our supporters who has knocked on
   5,000 doors and he’s from the Meredith area and he’s a rock star in our
   organization,” Smith said.
