One of the Worst Super Bowls Ever

The Denver Broncos win a grim, tedious, maddeningly ugly football game.

   By [10]Justin Peters
   Peyton Manning Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning fumbles the
   ball during the fourth quarter against the Carolina Panthers in Super
   Bowl 50 at Levi's Stadium.

   Matthew Emmons-USA TODAY Sports

   Super Bowl 50 was a grim, joyless, maddeningly ugly football game. As
   far as I was concerned, it was over in the first quarter, after Denver
   put up a quick 10 points; only three teams in [11]Super Bowl history
   have overcome a 10-point deficit to win the game, and it was clear
   early on that the Carolina Panthers weren't going to be the fourth. In
   the end, Denver won by the comfortable score of 24–10.

   Panthers quarterback Cam Newton, the league MVP, played like [15]Mr.
   Bean: tentative, befuddled, and [16]constantly falling down—Newton was
   sacked six times. Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, who is basically
   an old bag of dust at this point, was himself sacked five times. Even
   when he was upright, he wasn't making anything happen: Manning threw
   for a mere 141 yards on 13 completions Sunday night.

   The game was sloppy and slow—neither team could convert on third down
   to save their lives—and, worse, it was aesthetically depressing,
   featuring a handful of ugly turnovers and what seemed like 300
   pointless 2-yard runs from scrimmage. [17]Even the commercials were
   terrible! (You know the Super Bowl was lackluster when its most
   memorable commercial starred an [18]anthropomorphic intestine. By which
   I mean [19]Drake.) So, yeah, Super Bowl 50 was a bad game. But it
   wasn't even close to the worst Super Bowl of all time.

   I spent the past two months watching every Super Bowl ever for Slate,
   and my primary takeaway was that most Super Bowls are terrible. There
   have only been a handful of Super Bowls over the years that have been
   exciting, close games. And it just so happens that a lot of those games
   have been played over the past decade. This recent stint of exciting
   Super Bowls has skewed the modern viewer’s perspective. Tonight was a
   classic Super Bowl, because it sucked, and most Super Bowls suck.

   There are two types of bad Super Bowls, basically: blowouts and
   grinders. Sunday's bad Super Bowl was a grinder: a game in which
   neither team can establish any offensive momentum, thus keeping the
   score close enough to sustain at least minor viewing interest. A
   grinder game is far preferable to a blowout, in my opinion. A blowout
   requires a significant offensive imbalance, with one quarterback having
   a great game and the other having a terrible game.

   Neither Newton nor Manning had all-time terrible games—they minimized
   interceptions, after all, and they didn't do anything spectacularly
   stupid. Newton did not display his MVP form Sunday night, no, but
   he did at least throw for 245 yards and only one interception. Peyton
   Manning didn't do anything memorable, but, then, neither did he do
   anything memorably bad, like [20]toss a preventable pick-six to Tracy
   Porter to clinch his team's defeat, as he did as a member of the
   Indianapolis Colts in Super Bowl XLIV.

   Super Bowl 50 was a really bad game, but let's put it in perspective.
   In Super Bowl XII—which [21]I've ranked as the worst Super Bowl of all
   time—Broncos quarterback Craig Morton threw four interceptions and
   completed exactly one pass that didn't immediately lead to a turnover
   or go for negative yardage; Cowboys kicker Efren Herrera, for his part,
   missed three field goals in the second quarter. In Super Bowl XXXVII,
   Rich Gannon threw five interceptions. Super Bowl XXVII featured 11
   turnovers: four interceptions and an astounding seven lost fumbles.

   Sunday night was a tedious football game, yes, but when viewed against
   the cavalcade of suck that characterizes Super Bowl history, Super Bowl
   50 doesn't even come close to the bottom. I'll call it the 11^th-worst
   Super Bowl in history: slightly worse than Super Bowl XXXIII, in which
   the Falcons' Chris Chandler threw three interceptions in the course of
   losing to John Elway's Broncos, and not as bad as Super Bowl XXVII, in
   which the Cowboys beat the Bills 52–17. The game was just a really,
   really, really bad grinder. Come next year, we won't even remember it.
