Bristol Central Wrestling Captains Are One Tough Bunch

   [4]Nick Greene[5]Contact Reporter

   BRISTOL — Lying in a hospital bed following surgery, Julian Galindez
   figured he'd never wrestle again. Kris Nizielski spent part of his
   junior year walking with cane. Only a year ago, Shane Oxton wasn't even
   a full-time varsity wrestler and had recently fractured his back. Noah
   Cruz has been hampered by ankle injuries and most recently a
   concussion.

   Despite all that, the four captains of the Bristol Central wrestling
   team are back. They may have been taken down, but they wouldn't allow
   themselves to be pinned.

   The perseverance and toughness of Galindez, Nizielski, Cruz and Oxton
   has guided the Rams to a 12-4 record, already more wins than last
   season, and put them in the thick of things in Class L. Only a recent
   loss to No. 6 Middletown has taken Bristol Central out of the CCC South
   title equation. Though not in the top 10, the Rams have regularly
   received votes in the Norwich Bulletin high school wrestling poll.

   In a sport that Rams coach Matt Boissonneault calls "a fight with
   rules," few wrestlers are better examples of getting up and dusting
   themselves off than Bristol Central's foursome.

   "They're growing as people," Boissonneault said. "I think the skills
   these kids are getting for life is really what is the most important."

   Galindez tore the ACL, PCL and meniscus in his right knee during
   football drills before his junior season.

   "I was on the ground and all I could think about was wrestling,"
   Galindez said. "I thought it was all over for me. I thought I was never
   going to come back. I was just down in the dumps."

   Galindez, who wrestles at 160 pounds, says the lowest he got was the
   day after surgery, lying in the hospital with shooting pain in his
   knee. But he rebounded quickly.

   "I wasn't going to let this anchor me down — I was going to fight
   through it and make it a positive thing," he said.

   After a mediocre sophomore season as a heavyweight, Nizielski was off
   to a great start as a junior, with 12 wins in his first 13 matches. But
   in that 14th match something went wrong in his back; he was told it
   most likely was nerve issue. He sat out the rest of the season, needing
   a cane to walk through the school hallways.

   "Mentally it was a big drain," Nizielski said. "Those first 10 wins
   felt great for me, but then I got the injury and it just felt like
   everything was lost."

   Oxton fractured his back while pole-vaulting as a sophomore, limiting
   offseason wrestling training heading into his junior season. The senior
   who wrestles at 145 pounds couldn't crack a full-time spot as a junior
   — rotating between varsity and junior varsity.

   "Some of the kids who are new to wrestling are having a hard time
   finding the motivation to work hard," Oxton said. "I tell them my sense
   of motivation — they need to find theirs to keep them pushing and
   pushing."

   Cruz, a 220-pounder who is also the starting quarterback for the
   football team, was a Class L runner-up a year ago despite lingering
   ankle problems from football. He missed the first month of his junior
   year, then the first two weeks of this season before being sidelined
   for two weeks recently with a concussion.

   "What they do well is they talk [to the younger kids] about their own
   experiences, and coming from a kid it is much more powerful than coming
   from an adult," Boissonneault said.

   All four captains have battled back to find success this season.
   Galindez is 17-5, named an outstanding wrestler at the Plainville
   tournament. Nizielski is 22-5, winning a title at the Bristol Central
   tournament and advancing to the finals of last weekend's Ridgefield
   tournament.

   Oxton is 24-2, winning a title at the Bristol Central tournament, and
   Cruz (14-2) returned to the mats last weekend and should be one of the
   favorites going into this month's Class L tournament.

   "My message is: 'Keep working hard — if you don't work hard for one
   second, that could make or break you,'" Galindez said. "I want the JV
   guys to know that you don't stop fighting, no matter what."
