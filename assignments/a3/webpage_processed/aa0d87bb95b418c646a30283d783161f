Love...but


   by Amyk197120

   it could use a few updates and changes. I just downloaded the newest
   update today & I don't see any new fashion collections. It would be
   great if the clothing could be updated seasonally...for fresh choices &
   to keep it entertaining. The amount of time you have to wait to enter a
   fashion show if you miss one is RIDICULOUS. I can understand a few
   hours, but nearly a day to wait and only a small time-window to enter
   is annoying. I like that daily rewards have been offered. It would be
   great to have additional hairstyle & makeup choices...and we should NOT
   have to purchase a hairstyle repeatedly. If we buy it, it should be a
   choice & be free to switch back. That's also annoying. Some of the
   clothing prices and point values don't make sense either...$250,000 for
   a dress that has a point value of 4, or $75,000 for a piece of jewelry
   worth 2 points. It's very inconsistent. I also wish we could reorganize
   our closets if we want to. Overall, it's an entertaining game for
   now...I just believe there need to be constant updates with fresh items
   to keep people interested. Fun game. :)

Boring and Expensive


   by JennJenn2104639274

   This game is ok. The concept is fine. The problems I have with it are
   1) it is hard to get enough resources to better my skills for
   promotions. 2) everything costs an excessive amount of diamonds to buy.
   3) it's hard to get enough money when you can't get promoted due to
   lack of resources. 4) hard to win 3 stars on parties or fashion shows
   due to everybody having really expensive outfits. 5) When I try to
   submit an outfit either for a party or fashion show, I can't exit the
   game. I can't get the outfit to go through. It's just stuck there. I
   hit the submit button and it acts like it's stuck. Fix it please.
   Haven't been able to submit outfits for anything since the last two
   updates. FIX IT!
   This game used to be fun but it's hard to progress in anything
   whatsoever. I've been stuck on the same job level due to the fact that
   I need 100 microphones and 100 music notes. Isn't that a little
   excessive? I haven't played in awhile because of it being so hard to
   progress. I find maybe one or two microphones or notes with all of my
   energy searching. If you fix these problems I will play more and rate
   higher.

THIS UPDATE IS A JOKE


   by Bubble blaze78

   Wow Nanobit you have really outdone yourself this time. It's been over
   6 months since the last update and this one didn't even give us new
   clothes, shoes or accessories. It's unbelievable to me that you come
   out with a xmas party to throw and snow on he ground after Christmas.
   Nanobit continues to make money and doesn't use it to improve their
   game. They still allow people to hold multiple spots in the lists, they
   allow the same user to have multiple accounts and even have both of
   their avatars at the same party, they still allow people wearing less
   fashionable clothes win over higher fashionable clothes . Looking at he
   best dressed list is a joke they claim if you wear the same outfit to
   several parties it lowers your fashion rating yet several people on
   that list NEVER CHANGE! The players have been complaining for months
   about the computer generated players in the fashion shows yet they
   still continue to show up and steal our social points and top spots. I
   only continue to play this game Witt a few friends. As soon as someone
   else figures out how to make a game like superstar life I will happily
   delete this game. Once again Nanobit has proven to live up to their
   greedy lying reputation.
