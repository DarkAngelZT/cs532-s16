Usage Instructions

   If you do not have a AWS account, you should get one by registration
   with your credit card on AWS
   Once you choose this product, put it in the shopping cart, and then
   checkout in Guest mode with no registration required, you need to fill
   out your necessary contact information which cannot different to your
   billing information, and then you will be directed to www.paypal.com,
   as payment will be handled by PayPal exclusively. PayPal offers 2
   options for your payment, namely PayPal and 4 major credit cards or
   debit card payment. For the latter, you need to click and expand the
   credit/debit card payment sub-menu, and once you finish your
   credit/debit card payment there, PayPal will invite you to join PayPal
   for faster future checkout, but that is optional. Now you should click
   to go back to Cloudata Inc (CloudBnB Marketplace), and you should be
   patient as it might take a few or more minutes (definitely not 10
   seconds) to for the system to provision an AWS instance (our product)
   for you to launch your cluster.
   Once come back to CloudBnB Marketplace site, which means your payment
   has been verified and the AWS instance has been launched. Now you
   should check your email, you should receive an message from PayPal
   regarding your payment, as well as the following messages for CloudBnB
   Marketplace: 1. an invoice email; 2. an brief instruction email with
   the launched AWS instance's public IP address and a keypair file as
   attachment, download it, and now you can log in your AWS instance as
   follows:
   ssh -i 1lclickaws.pem root@public-ip-address
   Once log in, be root by typing: sudo su in the remote command shell.
   First change your root password by typing: passwd and enter your
   password twice after promotion, then edit the file named .bashrc under
   /usr/share/tomcat, which includes following 2 lines:
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='OurAccessKeyID'
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='OurSecretAccessKey'
   Replace our defunct AWS credentials in the file with your own working
   AWS credentials as follows:
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='YourAccessKeyID'
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='YourSecretAccessKey'
   and save it. Now it is all under your own control, and your can start
   to define and launch your cluster to issue your commands to the whole
   cluster. In your browser, type
   http://your-instance-public-ip-address:8080/s2gui, a GUI will show up,
   all operations are very intuitive.
