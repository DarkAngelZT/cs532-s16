   [97]Quick hits from Canes‚Äô morning skate

   Quick hits from the morning skate: Canes-Jets

   The Carolina Hurricanes will be without defenseman Justin Faulk and
   goalie Cam Ward on Tuesday against the Winnipeg Jets, but Canes coach
   Bill Peters said both should be close to returning.

   Faulk, who has missed the past two games with a lower-body injury, took
   part in the morning skate Tuesday at PNC Arena. Peters said he would
   not play against the Jets but should go through a full practice
   Wednesday and be with the team for the trip to Ottawa.

   The Canes on Tuesday recalled goalie Daniel Altshuller from the
   Charlotte Checkers to serve as a backup to starter Eddie Lack for the
   Jets game. Peters said Ward, who was injured Saturday during the New
   York Islanders game, also could go on the one-game trip to Ottawa.

   ‚ÄúIf this is Game 82 and we need to win, he‚Äôs available, but it‚Äôs not,‚Äù
   Peters said. ‚ÄúWith the history of the injuries he‚Äôs had we want to
   smart about this.‚Äù

   Feb. 5 meeting: The Canes jumped to a 4-0 lead over the Jets and won
   5-3 when the two teams played Feb. 5 in Winnipeg.

   Asked what his team could take away from that win, Peters said, ‚ÄúNot a
   lot really because coming out of that All-Star break it‚Äôs so hard. Both
   games coming out of that break for us were uncharacteristic. The more
   recent games are a more true indication of how both teams play.‚Äù

   The Canes were lackluster in the first game after the break, losing 4-1
   at Calgary. Two nights later, Phil Di Giuseppe, Andrej Nestrasil,
   Jordan Staal and Faulk all scored in the first against the Jets.

   The Jets pulled within 4-3 in the third before Nestrasil scored again
   with 1:20 left in regulation.

   ‚ÄúWe learned a valuable lesson there, just in terms of quickness and
   style of game,‚Äù Jets coach Paul Maurice said Tuesday. ‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt ready
   to play that game. Played better in the second, solid in the third and
   more the way our team has looked more recently.‚Äù

   The Jets have won their last four road games and also have won the past
   five games at PNC Arena.Hainsey, Flavin paired: With Faulk out, the
   Canes had Ron Hainsey paired with Jaccob Slavin, John-Michael Liles
   with Brett Pesce and Noah Hanifin with Michal Jordan on the back end at

   [100]NHL Jets vs. Hurricanes Picks & Predictions for February 16

   Jets vs. Hurricanes Pick The Winnipeg Jets and Carolina Hurricanes look
   to have another high-scoring contest when they meet tonight at 7PM ET.
   Carolina is 25-21-10 overall, 13-9-6 at home and 21-17 with the under.
   Winnipeg is 25-27-3 overall, 12-14-2 on the road and 27-24 with the
   under. Winnipeg has won seven of the last 10 in this series, but
   Carolina won the lone meeting this season. These two hit the over in
   the lone meeting as well.

   According to oddsmakers at RealBets , the Hurricanes are the slight
   favorite in tonight‚Äôs game, as Carolina is getting odds of -110 to win,
   while the Jets are getting a money line of +100 to prevail. The
   over/under total has been set at 5 goals.

   These teams played on Feb. 5 and Carolina beat Winnipeg, 5-3. Both
   teams have issues in next. Carolina lost netminder Cam Ward in their
   6-3 win over the New York Islanders on Saturday due to a lower-body
   injury. The Jets also lost defenseman Mark Stuart for a month due to a
   broken hand. He‚Äôs listed as doubtful for this game. Winnipeg‚Äôs Ondrej
   Pavelec is back in net for the second time since mid-November.

[102]NHL Picks: Capitals will skate past Kings in battle of NHL heavyweights

   February 16, 2016
   [103]NHL Picks: Capitals will skate past Kings in battle of NHL
   heavyweights

   The Kings and Capitals will clash in a battle of NHL titans. Welcome to
   NHL Picks where CBSSports.com hockey writers Chris Peters and Adam
   Gretz make their predictions for all of the day‚Äôs games.

   Los Angeles Kings at Washington Capitals , 7 p.m. ET

   In a game between division leaders, it wouldn‚Äôt be a stretch to view
   this as a potential Stanley Cup Final preview, early as it may be. The
   Kings still have a big lead in the Pacific, but the Caps have a
   commanding lead in both the Metropolitan Division and the rest of the
   league in the President‚Äôs Trophy race.

   The Caps were the first team to make it to 40 wins last week and will
   be looking to make it 41 against a team that has made a habit of being
   tough to play against.

   There are a lot of other angles in this game, too. Capitals forwards
   Justin Williams and Mike Richards will be playing against the team that
   they won two Stanley Cups with for the first time. Williams won the
   Conn Smythe as playoff MVP in 2014 and left the team on amicable terms,
   while Richards had his contract terminated in June following a
   drug-related charge.

   Meanwhile, the Kings are still hoping to get Jonathan Quick back after
   a one-week absence. Quick sustained a lower-body injury in the closing
   minutes of a game against the Boston Bruins . He remains day-to-day and
   currently owns a 28-14-2 record with a .918 save percentage and 2.23
   goals-against average. The Kings went 1-2-0 in his absence.

   If he does return Tuesday, Quick will get back just in time to face the
   most dangerous offense in the NHL, averaging 3.30 goals-per-game. Alex
   Ovechkin has six goals over his current four-game scoring streak. That
   has allowed him to overtake the goal-scoring lead with 35 so far this
   season.

   The game could also mark the return of Capitals defenseman Brooks
   Orpik. It has not yet been made official whether or not he‚Äôll be in the
   lineup and may not be until closer to game time. He has not played
   since Nov. 10 with a lower-body injury. Prior to going down, the
   stay-at-home defenseman had three points in 14 games.

   These two teams have some similar styles, but there‚Äôs no question that
   the Caps have a depth advantage here. They‚Äôve also been excellent on
   home ice this year with a 20-4-2 record and are [‚Ä¶]

[105]Major Sports Records That Could Fall Soon

   [106]Major Sports Records That Could Fall Soon

   Peyton Manning just became the first NFL quarterback to 200 wins, and
   Brett Favre‚Äôs 199 could get some company in the "broken records club"
   in the near future.

   Most of the following big-time sports records look poised to go down in
   the next few weeks or months, though a couple might take a smidge
   longer. Either way, odds are 50-50 or better (fictional, made-up odds,
   of course) that their days could be numbered. (Knock on wood.)

   Some records seem more likely to be broken than others, as well. Here
   they are, ranked from Derek Jeter becoming the first unanimous MLB Hall
   of Famer (as equally feasible as not) to Wayne Rooney topping Sir Bobby
   Charlton as Manchester United‚Äôs leading goalscorer (barring anything
   crazy, it‚Äôs happening).

   Warning: There is a disproportionate number of references to the Golden
   State Warriors and Washington Capitals in this one. Sorry, not sorry.
   They are disproportionately good .

[108]Brooks Orpik returns to Capitals‚Äô blue line after 40-game absence

   February 16, 2016
   [109]Brooks Orpik returns to Capitals' blue line after 40-game absence

   . View photo AP Photo/Alex Brandon Not only will Mike Richards face his
   old Los Angeles Kings teammates for the first time Tuesday night at
   Verizon Center, but the Washington Capitals will get an added boost to
   their blue line.

   After not having played since Nov. 10, Brooks Orpik will be back in the
   Capitals‚Äô lineup on the third pairing with Dmitry Orlov . Orpik has
   missed the last 40 games with a lower-body injury. Taylor Chorney ,
   who‚Äôs done yeoman‚Äôs work in his absence, will get a press box seat.

   It‚Äôs been two weeks since Orpik, who‚Äôs averaged 19:15 of ice time this
   season, began practicing again with his teammates. While he‚Äôs been out,
   the Capitals have pulled away with the Eastern Conference lead, which
   made watching from the press box or his television a little easier. It
   also gave him time to watch the game from a different angle and
   potentially aid him going forward.

   ‚ÄúI think no matter what age you are you try to learn things from the
   game and kind of pick things up that maybe other guys are doing well or
   things that you can kind of implement to your game that can make you a
   better player,‚Äù Orpik said via Monumental Sports .

   According to General Fanager , the move also leaves Capitals GM Brian
   McLellan the ability to add about $1.15 million in salary cap space
   should he need to make a move before the Feb. 29 trade deadline.

   The Washington Post‚Äôs Isabelle Khurshudyan had great rundown of
   McLellan‚Äôs potential options for deadline day.
