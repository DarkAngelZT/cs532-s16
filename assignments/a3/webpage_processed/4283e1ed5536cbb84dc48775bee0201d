The Fantasy Islam of Reza Aslan

Welcome to the game of hiding what's in the Koran.

   Fantasy Islam: A game in which an audience of non-Muslims wish with all
   their hearts that Islam was a “Religion of Peace,” and a Muslim strives
   to fulfill that wish by presenting a personal version of Islam that has
   little foundation in Islamic Doctrine.

   As I have mentioned before, "Fantasy Islam" is a popular game among
   many non-Muslims and so-called “moderate” or “reformist” Muslims.  Reza
   Aslan appears to be such a Muslim.

   Reza Aslan was born in Iran.  In 1979, at the age of seven, he and his
   family fled the Iranian Revolution and came to the United States.  At
   the age of 15 he converted to evangelical Christianity, but later
   returned to Islam.  His website states that he is “an internationally
   acclaimed writer and scholar of religions.”  He is currently a
   Professor of Creative Writing at the University of California,
   Riverside.

   In 2005 Aslan wrote a book titled No god but God: The Origins,
   Evolution, and Future of Islam. The updated edition came out in 2011.
   This article addresses that updated edition.

   It should be noted that in his book Aslan listed The Life of Muhammad
   and the multi-volume work The History of al-Tabari, as among the books
   he “consulted.”  These are classical works by Muslim scholars and major
   sources for information about Muhammad and Islam.  Aslan even
   specifically mentions them as among those that have “catalogued” the
   story of Islam (p. xxiv).  Unfortunately, although Aslan claims that he
   “consulted” them, we will see that he apparently overlooked conflicting
   information in these works in favor of playing Fantasy Islam.

   Death Penalty for Apostasy is “Un-Quranic”

   On p. 121 Aslan stated that the death penalty for apostasy was
   “un-Quranic,” and he stated that nowhere in the Koran “is any earthly
   punishment prescribed for apostasy.”

   The only problem for Aslan is that in 4:89 of the Koran Allah commands
   Muslims to take hold of those apostates who have left Islam and “kill
   them wherever you find them.”  So the death penalty for apostasy from
   Islam is in the Koran.

   In addition, Muhammad said that death was the penalty for a Muslim who
   left Islam (e.g. Sahih Al-Bukhari, Nos. 6878 and 6923; and Sahih
   Muslim, No. 1676).  And Muhammad even specified the nature of that
   death:

   If someone changes his religion - then strike off his head!

   Al-Muwatta of Imam Malik ibn Anas, 36.18.15, in a section titled
   “Judgement on Abandonment of Islam.”

   No Foundation in the Koran for Stoning

   On p. 71 Aslan wrote about the “misogynistic tendencies” of Umar, the
   second Caliph, and how Umar

   instituted a series of severe penal ordinances aimed primarily at
   women.  Chief among these was the stoning to death of adulterers, a
   punishment which has absolutely no foundation whatsoever in the Quran
   but which Umar justified by claiming it had originally been part of the
   Revelation and had somehow been left out of the authorized text.  Of
   course, Umar never explained how it was possible for a verse such as
   this “accidentally” to have been left out of the Divine Revelation of
   God[.]

   It is a common play in Fantasy Islam to claim that stoning is not a
   part of Islam because it is not in the Koran, so let’s take a look at
   this claim.

   In the first place, it is correct to state that the Koran says nothing
   about stoning.  The original punishment for adultery in the Koran
   (4:15) focused on women and confining them to their houses until they
   died; but there was a key provision at the end of this verse: “or Allah
   ordains for them some (other) way.”

   Muhammad later received a “revelation” from Allah explaining that
   “other way”:

   'Ubada b. As-Samit reported: Allah's Messenger (SAW) saying: Receive
   (teaching) from me, receive (teaching) from me.  Allah has ordained a
   way for those (women).  When an unmarried male commits adultery with an
   unmarried female (they should receive) one hundred lashes and
   banishment for one year.  And in case of married male committing
   adultery with a married female, they shall receive one hundred lashes
   and be stoned to death.

   Sahih Muslim, No. 1690

   So now, instead of confinement, the punishment for adultery would be
   lashing and stoning.  The punishment of lashing was codified in 24:2 of
   the Koran.  Muhammad considered stoning as the appropriate penalty for
   adultery up to his death.  He ordered many an adulterer to be stoned,
   as did his successors.

   Umar did make the claim that the Verse of Stoning had been left out
   when the Koran was compiled (e.g. Sahih Al-Bukhari, No. 6830).  But
   when the Koran was being compiled Umar had tried to get it included.
   However, the standard for including a “revelation” as a verse was that
   it had to be certified by two witnesses, and there appeared to be only
   one witness: Umar.

   But in reality there was a second witness, Muhammad’s favorite wife
   Aisha:

   It was narrated that 'Aishah said: "The Verse of stoning and of
   breastfeeding an adult ten times was revealed, and the paper was with
   me under my pillow.  When the Messenger of Allah died, we were
   preoccupied with his death, and a tame sheep came in and ate it."

   Sunan Ibn Majah, No. 1944

   Even though on p. 70 Aslan had written that “nearly one sixth of all
   ‘reliable’ hadith can be traced back to Muhammad’s wife Aisha,” the
   idea of using her as a witness apparently came up against 2:282 of the
   Koran.  This verse requires the testimony of two women in order to
   equal that of one man in property matters.  So even though both Umar
   and Aisha claimed there had been a stoning verse “revealed,” we would
   still only have at best one and one-half witnesses, therefore falling
   short of the two witnesses required to include a verse in the Koran.
   It would appear that this is why there is no Verse of Stoning in the
   Koran.  Nevertheless, it is still a part of Islam:

   Now the punishment of adultery has been fixed, which is stoning to
   death.  That punishment also remained in force during the times of the
   Rightly-Guided caliphs (successors of the Messenger of Allah) and that
   remained the unanimous opinion of all the jurists and scholars
   afterwards…The law that prescribes stoning the adultery [sic] to death
   is supported by authentic hadeeths, and their narrators are numerous,
   and hence, scholars grade those hadeeths as mutawatir [frequently
   reported].  A Muslim has, therefore, no choice except to acknowledge
   and accept it.

   Tafsir Ahsanul-Bayan, Vol. 3, p. 665

   Muhammad’s “Political Marriages”

   Aslan pointed out that Muhammad had been married to nine different
   women over the course of ten years; he explained that most of these
   marriages had been political arrangements to forge links outside the
   Muslim community.  Aslan mentioned two of those “marriages” on p. 64:

   His marriage to Rayhana, a Jew, linked him with the Jewish tribe of
   Banu Qurayza, while his marriage to Mariyah, a Christian and a Copt,
   created a significant political alliance with the Christian ruler of
   Egypt.

   However, two of the works “consulted” by Aslan have this to say about
   these “marriages”:

   Rayhana: Rayhana was among the female captives taken when the Muslims
   conquered the Banu Qurayza tribe.  Muhammad supervised the beheading of
   600-900 of the captured Jewish males (combatants and non-combatants)
   and picked Rayhana for himself as his share of the plunder.  Some of
   the women were sold to purchase horses and weapons, and others of the
   women were divided among the Muslim warriors. (The Life of Muhammad,
   pp. 461-468; The History of al-Tabari: The Last Years of the Prophet,
   pp. 137 and 141; and The History of al-Tabari: The Victory of Islam,
   pp. xiii, and 27-39).

   Mariyah: Muhammad sent a letter to Al-Muqawqis, the Christian ruler of
   Egypt, “inviting” him to Islam.  Al-Muqawqis declined, but sent
   Muhammad either two or four slave girls.  Two of these slave girls were
   Mariyah and her sister Sarin.  Muhammad kept Mariyah as his slave
   concubine and gave Sirin to Hassan B. Thabit as a gift (The Life of
   Muhammad, pp. 499, 653, and 711, n. 129; The History of al-Tabari: The
   Last Years of the Prophet, pp. 137, 141 and 147; and The History of
   al-Tabari: The Victory of Islam, pp. xiii, 66, 100, and 131).

   With regard to the first “marriage,” after Muhammad and the Muslims got
   finished there simply wasn’t much left in terms of a Jewish tribe with
   which to be “linked.”  With regard to the second “marriage,” the ruler
   of Egypt simply sent some slave girls over for Muhammad to do with as
   he pleased.  There was no “significant political alliance.”

   No One Speaks for God

   In the prologue of his book, Aslan wrote (p. xxvi):

   No one speaks for God – not even the prophets (who speak about God).

   Aslan has some major conflicts with Allah and Muhammad.  For example,
   in the Koran we find Allah saying:

   He who obeys the Messenger (Muhammad) has indeed obeyed Allah[.]
   (4:80)
   [INS: :INS]

   And Muhammad himself said:

   Whoever obeys me, he obeys Allah, and whoever disobeys me, he disobeys
   Allah[.]

   Sahih Al-Bukhari, No. 7137

   To claim that no one speaks for God requires Aslan, a Muslim, to deny
   statements from Allah, the god of Islam, and Allah’s Messenger,
   Muhammad.

   Islam Has Never Had a Single Religious Authority

   On p. 283 Aslan made an amazing claim:

   Unlike Judaism and Christianity, however, Islam has never had a single
   religious authority…that is, a centralized religious authority that
   claims the right to speak for the entire Muslim community.

   One might expect to hear such a claim from a non-Muslim who knows
   little about Islam.  But Aslan says he is a Muslim and his book is
   about Islam.  To make such a claim, Aslan had to not only dismiss the
   Koran verse and hadith mentioned in the previous section, but he also
   had to dismiss Koran verses such as these:

   Chapter 33, Verse 36:

   It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger,
   have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their
   decision.  And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he had indeed
   strayed into a plain error.

   Chapter 59, Verse 7:

   And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad) gives you, take it; and
   whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it).  And fear Allah; verily,
   Allah is Severe in punishment.

   Chapter 4, Verse 115:

   And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger (Muhammad) after the
   right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the
   believers' way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn
   him in Hell - what an evil destination!

   And Aslan also had to dismiss the following statement from his prophet
   Muhammad:

   Whoever obeys me will enter Paradise, and whoever disobeys me is the
   one who refuses (to enter it).

   Sahih Al-Bukhari, No. 7280

   To deny the centralized, singular religious authority of Muhammad is to
   deny Islam.

   Muslims, Christians and Jews are One Big Ummah

   On p. 101 Aslan wrote that Muhammad believed that although the Muslim,
   Christian and Jewish religions each

   comprised its own distinct religious community (its own individual
   Ummah), together they formed one united Ummah…Muhammad aligned his
   community with the Jews in Medina because he considered them, as well
   as the Christians, to be part of his Ummah.

   To be valid, this claim would have meant that Muhammad rejected both
   the words of Allah in the Koran, and his own teachings:

   In the Koran we find that Allah is angry with the Jews, and the
   Christians are misguided because they believe that Jesus is the son of
   God (1:7).  Muslims are commanded not to make friends with Jews and
   Christians (5:51), although Muslims can pretend to be friends if the
   situation so dictates (3:28).  Jews are among the worst enemies of
   Islam (5:82).  Muslims are commanded to fight Jews and Christians until
   the Jews and Christians pay protection money with willing submission
   and feel themselves subdued (9:29).  Allah curses the Jews and the
   Christians (9:30).  And Jews and Christians are among the worst of
   creatures and “will abide in the fire of Hell” (98:6).

   Muhammad said:

   Jews and Christians are each worth only half of a Muslim (Sunan Ibn
   Majah, No. 2644).

   Do not greet the Jews and the Christians before they greet you and when
   you meet any one of them on the roads force him to go to the narrowest
   part of it (Sahih Muslim, No. 2167).

   The Hour will not be established until you fight against the Jews, and
   the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say, 'O Muslim!  There
   is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him (Sahih Al-Bukhari, No. 2926).

   The Jews were grave robbers (Sahih Al-Bukhari, No. 3452).

   Jews and Christians will take the place of Muslims in Hell (Sahih
   Muslim, No. 2767R1).

   I will expel the Jews and Christians from the Arabian Peninsula and
   will not leave any but Muslims (Sahih Muslim, No. 1767).

   Muhammad did not reject the Koran or his own teachings, but Aslan had
   to in order to make the claim of there being one, big Ummah.

   Muhammad and the Banu Qaynuqa

   On p. 91 Aslan wrote that the Jewish Banu Qaynuqa tribe had broken
   their oath of mutual protection with the Muslims and had therefore
   committed treason; so, according to “Arab tradition,” the men of the
   tribe were to be killed, and the women and children were to be sold
   into slavery.  But Aslan wrote that everyone was shocked when Muhammad
   “rejected traditional law” and simply exiled the tribe from Medina.

   But some of the works “consulted” by Aslan tell a different story.  In
   reality, after the Banu Qaynuqa were defeated, Muhammad actually wanted
   to kill his fettered captives, but he was persuaded otherwise by
   ‘Adbullah b. Ubayy, who went to the point of grabbing Muhammad by the
   collar to get him to exile the Banu Qaynuqa instead of killing them.
   Muhammad finally had this to say about the Banu Qaynuqa: “Let them go;
   may God curse them, and may he curse [b. Ubayy] with them” (The History
   of al-Tabari, The Foundation of the Community, p. 86; and The Life of
   Muhammad, p. 363).

   Conclusion

   On p. 286 Aslan stated that Islam was a personal religion with “no
   mediator between the believer and God,” and “all people have the
   ability to discern God’s will for themselves.”  He called this a
   “radical creed” that some have used

   to develop wholly new interpretations of Islam that foster pluralism,
   individualism, modernism, and democracy; others have used it to
   propound an equally new ideal of Islam that calls for intolerance,
   bigotry, militancy, and perpetual war.  Which of these interpretations
   is “true Islam” is an unanswerable question, since the rejection of
   institutional authority means that all interpretations of Islam must be
   considered equally authoritative.

   So according to Aslan, Islam is whatever anybody wants it to be, and on
   top of that it can still be called Islam!  And so Fantasy Islam is
   played.
