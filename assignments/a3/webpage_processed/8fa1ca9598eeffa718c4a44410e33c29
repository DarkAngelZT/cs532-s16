Ron Rivera: ‘We didn’t come here to finish second’

   Broncos win Super Bowl 50 behind dominant defensive performance

   The Denver Broncos harassed Cam Newton and the Carolina Panthers all
   night on the way to winning Super Bowl 50.
   by [238]SI Wire
   [239]Email
   Posted: Sun Feb. 7, 2016

   After the Carolina Panthers fell to the Denver Broncos 24–10 in Super
   Bowl 50, head coach Ron Rivera expressed his disappointment over his
   team’s loss after the game.

   “I don’t want to diminish what we did this year, but we didn’t come
   here to finish second,” Rivera said.

   Rivera added that his team will use the loss in Super Bowl 50 as a
   stepping stone for the future.

   “We have an opportunity to learn and grow from this experience,” Rivera
   stated.

   Rivera, who was named the AP Coach of the Year this season, led the
   Panthers from a 3–8–1 record just 15 months ago to a 15–1 regular
   season record this season and a Super Bowl appearance.
