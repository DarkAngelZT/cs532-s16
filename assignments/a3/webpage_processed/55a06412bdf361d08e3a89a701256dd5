Can You Create / Publish An Independent Comic And Remain Sane?

   [40]pic1 How to create and publish a comic independently without losing
   your sanity:

   Let me start out by saying that I’m lying to you. If you want to have
   any chance at succeeding with your comic you have to be a little crazy
   to begin with. You have to believe that somehow you’re that specially
   talented little snowflake who will succeed against overwhelming odds to
   make your dreams come true while simultaneously having a maniacal
   amount of drive and self-motivation to keep at it while all the
   evidence in the world points to the exact contrary conclusion. It’s a
   tough business. However the goal of this article is not to send you
   running in abject terror for the hills even if that would be the smart
   thing to do. No, I’d like to try and prepare and daresay encourage
   those of you with the creative itch to dip an extremity or two into
   this black pool of despair….wait I did it again. Never mind, let’s get
   on with it.
   [41]pic2
   First a little info about the fellow who seems to think he can tell you
   something you don’t already know. My name is Rivenis and my experience
   comes from working on my own independent comic series Diskordia which
   is currently running on kickstarter to print the first book. I first
   started publishing it in 2010 and now have 14 issues completed and
   published online. I know that working in a team carries its own unique
   challenges and rewards but for the purposes of this article we’re
   focusing on the one man operation, the so-called cartoonist who does
   everything by him/herself from conceptualizing the story to lettering
   the pages and marketing. Believe me this is A LOT of work for one mad
   genius (Or wannabe). I’ll be lining up some of the inevitable pitfalls
   and some advice on how to navigate them.
   [42]pic3

   1) You will be ignored.
   Don’t expect to come onto the scene with your amazingly unique voice
   and sick drawing skills and to make a giant instantaneous splash. Just
   don’t. Behind every ‘new’ creator that you’ve discovered that seemed to
   make it big overnight is a much longer story of grinding and building
   up a following over time. There may indeed be the odd unicorn creator
   whose comic instantly became famous overnight. I’ve just never met or
   heard of them. I’ve witnessed creators whose disappointment was so
   intense from the lack of positive feedback that it killed their
   motivation entirely. You can get ahead of the curve by avoiding this
   all together. When you start out no one will care about you and no one
   will read your comic, but you will make it anyway for the singular
   reason that it is what you are meant to do on this earth. Everything
   else is secondary.

   2) You will have to make sacrifices.
   No getting around this. You will have to find the time to hone your
   skills and produce your comic. And to do it with anything approaching
   the level of consistency required to have even a slither of a chance of
   succeeding you will have to make it a priority. Personally speaking my
   sacrifice is mainly monetary. To say I’ve been living on a tight budget
   for the last five years would be euphemistic at best. There’s also the
   matter of a social life. If you are holding down a full time job while
   working on the comic in your spare time prepare to kiss that goodbye.
   It’s not as hopeless as it seems though. With extremely good time
   management and planning you can juggle pretty much anything. You just
   have to decide on your own hierarchy of priorities and stick to it.

   [43]15 3) You will burn out
   An average issue of a full color comic takes hundreds of hours to
   produce. If you’re doing it all yourself while marketing it on social
   media like the demon you’ll have to be to make progress then eventually
   your mind will implode as if a black hole spontaneously appeared inside
   of it. Burnout is horrible; it’s what happens when you spend all of
   your creative mana so to speak and are turned into this pathetic thing
   that can’t even think of a new idea without feeling mental agony. I get
   depressed all the time and shrug it off but burnout makes me want to
   have never been born. If you haven’t experienced it for yourself then
   it would be hard for you to understand and also you would be extremely
   lucky. When I first started working on Diskordia I would rely on manic
   bursts of inspiration to work tirelessly on the books only to stop
   briefly to sleep and sometimes eat. Needless to say I crashed hard
   after every release. Do not make my mistake. The key to avoiding
   burnout is to pace yourself. Work less hours but work them
   consistently. Take regular breaks and even a day off here and there.
   Listen to your body and mind and be vigilant for the tell-tale signs of
   mental fatigue. Don’t rely on mania to get you to the finish line; it’s
   like holding down the Nos button on your creativity. Working smart will
   also increase your productivity. The first 2 issues of Diskordia were
   released between 2010 and 2011. That’s one year per issue while I was
   working stupid. The next 12 issues of the series were released between
   2012 and 2015 with my new smarter schedule. Notice the difference? Heck
   it’s a rare day for me to work more than 6 hours. Your creative
   resource is infinitely renewable but if you work smart you can avoid
   ever having an empty tank.

   4) You will get depressed
   Not as creatively devastating as the last example but unlike burnout
   depression is pretty much unavoidable. In fact some would say it’s
   integral to the ebb and flow of creative work. Your goal will be to
   stay as productive as possible while being assaulted by the feelings of
   worthlessness and inadequacy that will constantly assault you while you
   dedicate so much of yourself to this thing that you’re not entirely
   sure isn’t utter garbage. My advice: Talk to people, preferably people
   who understand your struggle. Find a support system, with the internet
   now there’s nothing stopping you from finding others on the same
   journey as yourself. I can personally attest to the awesomeness of the
   indie comic community. There are people who are just itching to help
   you succeed simply because you are brave enough to step into the
   industry. So don’t be a dick. Really I think that bares repeating.
   There’s no faster way to kill your career than to make enemies in this
   tight knit community. Be good to people and they will be good to you.

   [44]Rockstars-of-the-Dreamtime-II 5) Your body will fail you
   Crouching for endless hours on end in front of a monitor using your
   hands in a repeat motion; this is the story for most artists. The
   younger ones among us won’t even consider the long term deficits of
   this gruelling way of doing things. And they are numerous. Back and
   wrist injuries are most common. Some can be serious enough to halt
   productivity for weeks or months. The solution is easy. Take plenty of
   breaks and never work for more than an hour without getting up and
   taking a short lap or two around the room. Commit to regular daily
   wrist stretching exercises. Don’t know what these are? Just google
   them. There are tons of resources on this topic available. In fact
   exercise your whole body and eat well. This benefits everyone. The
   fitter and healthier you are the more productive you’ll be.

   6) You will suck at selling your comic
   Selling your work effectively is a skill that will take you years just
   to become competent at. Most creatives are also introverts who would
   rather spend all their time making the art in their secluded little
   caves. If you’re a cartoonist who wants to share their work you simply
   don’t have the luxury of ignoring this discipline. NO ONE will be
   better at selling your own work than you. No one will be able to draw
   on the passion well as effectively as the one whose passion brought the
   work into being. There are plenty of resources online with invaluable
   tips on selling your work to people. Practice your pitch on your
   friends. Practice in front of a mirror. Leap at any chance to speak
   publicly no matter how terrifying it is. You will get better. You’re
   still gonna suck though but that’s okay. Personally speaking I’m
   terrible at this. I couldn’t summarise my own work off the top of my
   head if you were pointing a bazooka at it. Hopefully though through all
   the rambling, bumbling and stammering your passion will still shine
   through and that is what resonates with people. You have something that
   the big guys at Marvel and DC will never have: a vested interest beyond
   the bottom line.

   I hope these tips or whatever the hell they ended up being were helpful
   for those of you interested in this field. And if you’d like you can
   take a look at my own contribution to the void Diskordia. It’s a
   surreal fantasy webcomic series that as I mentioned before is currently
   on kickstarter. Good luck with your own works.
