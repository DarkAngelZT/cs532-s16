[61]Peyton Manning mocks Eli's confused Super Bowl face

   SANTA CLARA, Calif. — The Panthers could blame this embarrassingly
   sloppy loss on everyone but Kony Ealy.

   The young Carolina defensive end did just about everything possible to
   keep the Panthers afloat in Super Bowl 50 on Sunday night, only to see
   his MVP-worthy effort go for naught[62] in a 24-10 loss to the Broncos
   at Levi’s Stadium.

   While Denver counterpart Von Miller [63]ended up taking that MVP trophy
   with an epic defensive showing of his own, Ealy certainly didn’t take a
   back seat in comparison.

   Peyton Manning and the Broncos couldn’t escape the Missouri product,
   who had a game-high three sacks, an interception, a forced fumble and a
   fumble recovery to go along with four tackles and a pass breakup.

   It was a stunning performance from the second-year pro, a second-round
   pick who had started just nine of his first 31 NFL games.

   “I don’t know what to say other than my teammates did a great job of
   putting me in position to make plays and Peyton didn’t help himself by
   holding on to the ball a little too long a lot of times,” Ealy said.

   Not only was Ealy’s interception the first of his pro career, but he
   also had almost as many sacks (three) in the Super Bowl as he had
   during the entire regular season (five).

   Ealy had not recorded a sack in the past seven games until he unloaded
   Sunday night as Denver’s outmatched offensive line appeared more
   preoccupied with containing Ealy’s more well-known teammates.

   “Kony played a heck of a football game,” Panthers coach Ron Rivera
   said. “Just an incredible game in a lot of ways. It’s just too bad we
   couldn’t do enough do enough to make it worthwhile.”

   Ealy’s performance was a big reason why the Panthers’ defense could
   still hold its head up afterward. Carolina lost despite holding Manning
   and the Broncos to just 174 total yards and forcing two turnovers.

   The interception by Ealy kept the Broncos from pulling away early and
   really showed the 6-foot-4, 273-pound lineman’s athleticism and
   versatility.

   Manning wasn’t expecting Ealy to drop into coverage and appeared to be
   so shocked by that development that threw it right to him at the
   Carolina 24 with Denver trying to expand its 13-7 lead.

   “You just have to come back and fight the next year,” Ealy said. “I
   can’t sit and dwell on this loss. It sucks, but at the end of the day,
   you can’t dwell on it.

   “The better team won,” Ealy added. “They showed up, they played and
   they didn’t make mistakes like we did. We couldn’t afford to do that.”
