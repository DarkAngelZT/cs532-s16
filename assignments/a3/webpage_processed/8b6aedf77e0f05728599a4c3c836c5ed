The Choice Coming To Theaters February 5 2016

   I am not one to read many books anymore, but I sure used to when I had
   more time. I only wish I had time to read books now, but oh well. I am
   sure one day when my babies are grown and have their own families, I
   will have plenty of time to read, right? That is how I think of it
   anyways.


   The Choice Coming To Theaters February 5 2016


   When I heard about [23]the book ‘The Choice’ and then about the movie
   coming out on February 5th, I was a little bit intrigued only because
   it looks like it will be a fabulous movie. Makes me want to pick up the
   book and read it before I see the movie. Yes, the movie looks that
   good. And, I am hearing rave reviews about both the book and the movie,
   so ya, it makes me want to see the movie and read that book!

   Have you read the book ‘[25]The Choice‘? What did you think of it? Are
   you excited to see the movie when it comes out on February 5th? Will
   you be going to the theater to see it or wait until it is on DVD? I
   think my hubby and I will go and see this movie in the theaters. We
   have not had a date night in a LONG time.


   The Choice Coming To Theaters February 5 2016


   About This Movie:

   When feisty medical student Gabby Holland moves in next door to
   perennial ladies’ man Travis Shaw, they embark on a surprising romantic
   journey neither imagined possible. Travis has always believed a serious
   relationship would cramp his easygoing lifestyle while Gabby is
   preparing to settle down with her long-term boyfriend—until an
   irresistible attraction between the unlikely couple upends both of
   their well-planned lives. Spanning a decade and tracing the evolution
   of a love affair that is ultimately tested by life’s most defining
   events, this story features a memorable ensemble of friends and family
   in Sparks’s beloved North Carolina setting, culminating with the
   question that every couple must ask themselves: how far would you go to
   keep the hope of love alive?
