Frequently Asked Questions

What is Robot Coin Game?

     Robot Coin Game was created to help people start off with Bitcoin.
   You defeat Robots and earn Bitcoin rewards. As you go up in Zones, you
   will encounter more powerful Robots who will give you more rewards. You
   can upgrade your attacks with your balance, to defeat Robots quicker.

Why do I get different Robots in a Zone?

     With each zone you face, a new higher leveled Robot will be
   introduced. You will still encounter lower leveled Robots also, but
   Robots that are the same level as the zone will appear more likely.

When can I cashout?

     You can cashout directly to your wallet once you reach a balance of
   20,000 satoshi. There is a withdraw fee of 5,000 satoshi. Expect to see
   your transaction in the blockchain within a few hours.

How do I win?

     You must attack a Robot until he has 0 hp. Once he is defeated, you
   will receive a reward. When you defeat all the Robots in a Zone, you go
   up a Zone, where the Robots increase in level and give out better
   rewards. Once you defeat the Robot in Zone 20, you will receive
   1,000,000 satoshis and you will be able to play again from the
   beginning! (Please note you will have to restart and lose all your
   upgrades)

What happens when I reach level 20?

     Congratulations you won!! Everytime you win, you'll earn a 2%
   permanent bonus! Since the game is over for you, you will have to
   restart back to the beginning of zone 1 and attack level 1.

Can I restart the game?

     Yes you can restart the game with the restart button. You will keep
   your balance, but keep in mind, you will start back to Zone 1 with
   level 1 upgrades. You typically want to restart if you did not upgrade
   enough and the game has gotten too hard.

I forgot my pin number!

     You can request an email with your pin number by clicking the "forgot
   pin" button.

Can I change my BTC address on my account?

     Yes of course, you can change it in your account popup.

Is there a referral program?

     Yes there is! You can find the link on the bottom of the page. You
   get a lifetime referral bonus from each of the users you bring,
   depending on how many referrals you bring. You will also only get the
   referral for activated users.

Can I advertise on your site?

     Absolutely! We have 2 spaces reserved for anyone who would like to
   advertise. Just go down to the Robots section and find the "Advertise
   Here" links
