Von Miller wins MVP; plenty of SB records as Broncos win 24-10

   Posted on February 7, 2016
   [60]Broncos logo / NFL Media Broncos logo / NFL Media

   Denver Broncos linebacker VON MILLER was voted the winner of the Pete
   Rozelle Trophy, awarded to the Super Bowl 50 Most Valuable Player.

   This marks the tenth time in Super Bowl history that a defensive player
   has been named Most Valuable Player. Linebacker MALCOLM SMITH of the
   Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLVIII was the last defensive player to
   receive the honor.

   The award is chosen by a panel of 16, comprised of members of the Pro
   Football Writers Association of America, selected members of the
   broadcast media and by fans interactively through the National Football
   League’s official website, NFL.com.

   Miller led a Broncos defense that recorded seven sacks, posting six
   tackles, two and half sacks, two forced fumbles, one pass defensed and
   two quarterback hits.

   Miller, a fifth-year player from Texas A&M, helped force two turnovers
   that were instrumental in setting up both Denver touchdowns. His
   first-quarter sack forced a fumble that was recovered by defensive end
   MALIK JACKSON in the end zone for a touchdown to the give the Broncos a
   10-0 lead. Miller’s second full sack of the game came in the fourth
   quarter and forced another fumble that was recovered at the Carolina
   nine-yard line by safety T.J. WARD. Four plays later, Broncos running
   back C.J. ANDERSON ran for a two-yard score to seal the Broncos 24-10
   win.
