DEADPOOL Said To Have Second After-Credits Scene Not Shown To Critics

   DEADPOOL Said To Have Second After-Credits Scene Not Shown To Critics

The embargo for 20th Century Fox's Deadpool starring Ryan Reynolds lifted
earlier this week to rave reviews from film critics around the nation.
However, there's one thing critics didn't see.

   According to Deadpool creator Rob Liefield, there will be a second
   after-credits scene with next week's nationwide release of the Ryan
   Reynolds starrer.  Whether that scene will be there purely for comedic
   effects or will have clues to the further cinematic adventures of
   Deadpool remains a mystery.


                    [tumblr_o277jpAP2V1rov369o1_1280.jpg]


     No one who's seen Deadpool so far has seen *all* of Deadpool.
     There's a second coda that won't arrive 'til the movie screens in
     theaters...
     — Rhett Reese (@RhettReese) [27]February 7, 2016


     Based upon Marvel Comics’ most unconventional anti-hero, DEADPOOL
     tells the origin story of former Special Forces operative turned
     mercenary Wade Wilson, who after being subjected to a rogue
     experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopts
     the alter ego Deadpool. Armed with his new abilities and a dark,
     twisted sense of humor, Deadpool hunts down the man who nearly
     destroyed his life. The film is directed by Tim Miller, with a
     screenplay by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, and stars Ryan Reynolds,
     Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein, T. J. Miller, Gina Carano, Brianna
     Hildebrand, Stefan Kapičić, and Leslie Uggams.

   Plus there is that instagram post from Munn where she's with Reynolds.
   I don't know if they're palying with us or if t's a real tease for
   Deadpool having a cameo on Apocalypse.

   Unlikely, Deadpool is on the modern timeline, and becomes Deadpool on
   the present timeline.
   Apocalypse is on the 80's.
   They basically spoil you that they beat Apocalypse.
   X-Men is not worthy of Deadpool.

   @StoneHex104 - X-Force is all about time travel so Cable could take
   Deadpool back to the 80's (with a sweet little Easter-egg about waking
   Apocalypse). Oh, the pop culture references there will be!!!

   @StoneHex104 "They basically spoil you that they beat Apocalypse. "
   WTF? Who on this entire planet thinks that Apocalypse has ANY CHANCE in
   hell of actually winning? lol. Some of these comments, man. smdh. What,
   you expect the movie to end with the death of the X-Men? lol
   Only horror and villain movies end with the villain winning. Can you
   imagine if Terminator ended with John and Sarah Connor dead, with the
   last shot being the Terminator returning to the future – mission
   accomplished? lol.
   Back to the Future II ends with Marty, his girlfriend, and the Doc all
   trapped in the alternate 1980s. Bif rules the world. End credits. Wow,
   what a great movie. Right? RIGHT?
   This is the reason no one likes the final ep of Quantum Leap. It's just
   incredibly unsatisfying and sad.

   If this does well, I hope Fox can work out an agreement with Warner
   Bros to allow Deadpool to kill Ambush Bug in the sequel. That would go
   down as an awesome scene seeing Ambush Bug wondering where he is and
   Deadpool comes to kill him because Ambush Bug doesn't belong in that
   world.
