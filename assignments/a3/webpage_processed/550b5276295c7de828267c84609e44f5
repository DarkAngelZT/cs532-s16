Indie Author Interview: Lisa B. Kamps

   Indie Author Interview with Lisa B. Kamps - Author of the Contemporary
   Sports Romance Series The Baltimore Banners.
   Lisa B. Kamps grew up with an overactive imagination, strong
   encouragement from her parents, and an insatiable infatuation with the
   Peanuts gang. That infatuation—along with an impatience she has yet to
   outgrow—jump-started her love of writing.
   Interview with Lisa B. Kamps

                            Author Lisa B. Kamps
                            Author Lisa B. Kamps

   Alan Kealey (Indie Author News): What is your (writing) background?
   Lisa B. Kamps: I started writing at an early age (I've always heard
   those voices in my head!), first for myself, and then for some friends.
   Everything just grew from that. In addition to writing fiction, I’ve
   worked in non-fiction and also spent some time as a freelance
   journalist.
   But fiction has always been my heart. As I got older, I realized this
   was something I wanted to do all the time, so I took the plunge! And no
   matter what happens in this crazy world of publishing, I'll still
   always write. It's not something I just "want" to do, it's something I
   "have" to do!
   Who are your favorite writers, your favorite books, and who or what are
   your writing influences?
   I've never actually given this one much thought. I was an avid reader
   growing up (still am), and read a lot of different books, different
   authors, different styles and voices. I'm sure every single one has
   influenced me in some way, and still does. But to narrow it down to
   just one or even a few? I honestly don't think I can do that.
   I do have writers on my automatic “buy” list: Linda Howard, Stephen
   King. Dean Koontz, Diana Gabaldon. Darynda Jones, Catherine Gayle, JRR
   Tolkien…yeah, quite a few. Favorite books? Again, quite a few. Pretty
   much every title by the authors above!
   When did you first know that you wanted to be a writer?
   It was never really a conscious decision, and there was never one
   single incident (that sticks out, anyway). I've always told stories,
   for as long as I could remember. I mean, I even wrote my own
   Peanuts/Snoopy stories because I was so impatient and couldn't wait for
   the Sunday comic strip. And my mom is always telling me how I would
   make up my own bedtime stories. It's just something I've always done.
   Now, if you want to know when I decided to take my writing serious and
   actually pursue it--that's been happening over the last several years.
   And especially this year. You know how some people need to be hit over
   the head with a two by four? Yeah…not me. I pretty much need to be
   whacked with a steel I-beam. I got that whack this past year, and here
   I am!
   Do you remember the first story you ever wrote?
   I don’t, but my mother does (vaguely)—it was a Peanuts story, and
   apparently Snoopy decided to become a detective, with Woodstock as his
   sidekick. I apparently had a little Sherlock Holmes thing going
   there...
   "I'll forget about everything else and just write [...]"
   Tell us about your writing process. Do you have a writing routine?
   I write at all times. On average, I'd say I’m at the keyboard 5-6 days
   a week. Again, if the words are really flowing, then it's 7 days.
   Sometimes may not be as long as others, depending on what else is going
   on, and if I have other writing business to take care of!
   On a typical day, I start by 9am, no excuses. I'll write for a few
   hours, take a break, and write for a few more hours into the evening.
   Generally, the hours after dinner are reserved for family or relaxing,
   but there have been times when I've been so caught-up that I'll forget
   about everything else and just write until the words start blurring!
   Please, describe your desk/workplace.
   I do have an office space, but I very rarely use it. I don't like being
   tied-down to any one spot. If I'm writing (you know, those fun first
   drafts!), I use my AlphaSmart and will write anywhere. Literally. If
   the weather is nice, I'm usually on our back patio pounding away at the
   keyboard. And yes, I've been known to be out there working even when
   it's 40 degrees outside (we have a nice fire pit, which helps take the
   chill off!). If the weather isn't cooperating, I'm usually in the
   living room, zoning out and doing my thing.
   For edits and such, I'm on my laptop--again, usually in the living room
   or sometimes outside. And every once in a while, I might actually use
   my office space!
   "You create, shape and polish."
   What do you find easiest about writing? What the hardest?
   The hardest? Putting yourself out there for the world to see. I mean,
   really putting yourself out there. You question every word you write,
   every story you tell. You create, shape and polish. Then you throw it
   out to the world and wait and wonder: is it good enough? Will they like
   it? And of course not everyone will, that's all part of it. But you
   don't take that to heart because if you do, you'll quit. And then you
   do it over and over, again and again. Yeah, thick skin is definitely a
   requirement!
   The easiest? Um…I honestly don't know. I don't think I'd ever call any
   of this easy. Maybe getting dressed for work?? No uniform required! Oh,
   and commuting is pretty easy, too--straight to my computer, no traffic
   at all (unless I'm tripping over our dog or cats!).
   What is the greatest joy of writing for you?
   The greatest joy? Hmm…I’d have to say it’s the fact that I get to live
   inside my head and create these really cool worlds and fill them with
   all sorts of people then share them with the world. How can you not
   love that?

   Lisa, please tell us a little about your Sports Romance Novel Break
   Away.
   BREAK AWAY is the 5th book in my hockey romance series, The Baltimore
   Banners. It’s a second chance romance featuring a cocky hockey player
   and a woman scarred by the past. Are second chances really possible?
   Maybe…if love can heal past mistakes.
   What inspired you to write the series The Baltimore Banners?
   I am a HUGE hockey fan, have been for years (huge shout-out to my
   Washington Capitals!!). I had this idea for a story featuring a sexy as
   hell goalie, and a strong feisty woman who was just independent enough
   to keep him on his toes—and so CROSSING THE LINE was born. I had so
   much fun writing it, and fell in love with the other players, and just
   knew they each needed their own stories. And suddenly, I realized I was
   writing a series!

                           Click to Read an Excerpt

   Who do you see as your target audience?
   I’d generally say women, age 21 to 70. But that is a huge
   generalization. I also have some male readers, so I don’t want them to
   feel left out. Yes, I include quite a bit of hockey and male bantering
   the series, which helps broaden its appeal!
   What makes your series special?
   It appeals to a broad audience, and features those life-bumps that
   everyone has experienced. And the characters are real, with hopes and
   dreams and fears—and they’ve all made mistakes that they’re trying to
   learn from. They’re not perfect, and readers easily identify with them.
   The stories are very character-driven, and I think that really appeals
   to the readers.
   "[...] sales have been strong"
   How would you describe the success of your self-published books so far?
   I’d say fairly successful! Haven’t hit any Bestseller lists yet, but I
   do have a loyal following—which is a good thing! And, knock-on-wood,
   sales have been strong and steady enough to allow me to do this
   full-time!
   "[...] stop talking and just write."
   Can you give some advice for other Authors regarding the writing
   process?
   The best piece of advice I can give (and have given) any aspiring
   writer is one that's been around for ages: Just do it. Don’t think
   about doing it, don’t talk about doing it, don't dream about doing it.
   Just sit your butt down and get those words on the page. Talking is
   easy, but if you're serious, stop talking and just write. You can fix
   it later, worry about it later, angst over it later. But you need to
   get those words on paper first. In this case, actions really do speak
   louder than words.
   Don't get so caught up in the rules that you end up hampering your
   creative flow. Yes, learn the rules, be aware of them, but don't let
   them rule your writing (or your creative process). There are so many
   rules out there that "they" say can't be broken. But guess what? They
   get broken all the time, and it works. Do what works for you, your
   story, your characters. Don't let the rules silence your unique voice.
   (Note: I'm not talking about grammar and punctuation--those are
   important. It's those other pesky rules, like don't write in first
   person, don't write about a sports hero, etc.)
   Are you working on another book project? Can you tell us a little about
   it?
   I’m always working on another project!
   In addition to the hockey series, I have a three-title spin-off
   featuring three friends who enter the restaurant business (The Maypole,
   which was featured in BODY CHECK, The Baltimore Banners Book 4). I hope
   to have those out by the late second half of 2016.
   I also have a firefighter series, titled FIREHOUSE FOURTEEN, scheduled
   to begin releasing in April 2016. That series has three titles so far,
   with more in the works!
   So yes, lot of exciting stuff planned!
   Where do you see the book market in 5 or 10 years? Will there be only
   eBooks and will book stores disappear like record stores disappeared?
   Contrary to the conflicting reports that have been floating around
   recently, I don't see digital publishing slowing down. In fact, I think
   it's going to keep growing, especially with each new generation and
   with all the rapid improvements of technology. We're living in a
   digital world, with information available at our fingertips in seconds,
   and the younger generations have come to expect that. I believe
   publishing is going to continue moving forward the same way, especially
   if you want to reach--and keep--the digital generation.
   Personally, I don’t see print books disappearing. At least, I hope not.
   But brick-and-mortar stores? Yeah, I think they might have a tough road
   ahead of them unless something changes. Too many already have gone out
   of business and closed.
   What is your e-reading device of choice?
   Kindle. I was a total Nook geek but with the direction and uncertainty
   surrounding B&N, I took the plunge and switched. And yeah, I like it!
   Do you write full-time or do you have a day job? When you're not
   writing, how do you spend your time?
   I just recently made the transition to full-time writer. And yes, it
   was a scary decision to make—still is! But this is what I’ve always
   wanted to do, and it was time—so now I’m living my dream!
   As for what I do in my free time--you're going to read this and think
   I'm the most boring person in the world but...you asked. Okay, on a
   typical day: get up in the morning (I'm an early riser), grab that
   all-important first cup of coffee, and walk the dog. Once enough
   caffeine has entered my system, I'll check email, Facebook, other
   social media. Check on sales and feedback, send out any responses, etc.
   All of this stops at 9am, because that's when writing starts (sometimes
   earlier, but never later). I'll write for a few hours then take a quick
   break, back to email, etc. Grab lunch. If there's any running around
   that needs to be done, I'll do it then. After that, it's back to
   writing, until dinner time and spending time with the family.
   Sometimes I'll grab another hour or two of writing after that, or I'll
   just read or watch television. Then it's bedtime, then morning, then do
   it all over again.
   "I love hearing from readers"
   How can readers connect with you?
   I love hearing from readers, and there’s lots of ways to connect with
   me!

   Jean-Pierre "JP" Larocque is a speed demon for the Baltimore Banners.
   He lives for speed off the ice, too, playing fast and loose with cars
   and women. But is he really a player, or is his carefree exterior
   nothing more than a show, hiding a lonely man filled with regret as he
   struggles to forget the only woman who mattered?
   Emily Poole thought she knew what she wanted in life, but everything
   changed five years ago. Now she exists day by day, helping care for her
   niece after her sister’s bitter divorce. It may not be how she
   envisioned her life, but she's happy. Or so she thinks, until JP
   re-enters her life. Now she realizes there’s a lot more she wants,
   including a second chance with JP.
   Can these two lost souls finally find forgiveness and Break Away to the
   future? Or will the shared tragedy of their past tear them apart for
   good this time?
   - "I'm giving this book 10 puck stars because wow just wow! This is not
   your typical story with a cocky hokey player no... JP is not afraid to
   show his emotions, truly cares about the people around him and
   struggles with his job just as anyone does! Then we have Emily whom I
   fell in love with since page 1 struck by tragedy 5 years ago she is
   trying to survive with what happened and her family.[...] I truly
   recommend this book." - Reader Review
