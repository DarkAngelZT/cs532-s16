The Late Show: Was Colbert Off His Game in Live Super Bowl Episode?

   The only person more nervous than Cam Newton and Peyton Manning on
   Super Bowl Sunday? [87]Stephen Colbert.

   Not only did the [88]Late Show rookie land the coveted post-game time
   slot on CBS — marking the first time a late-night program has
   aired after the NFL championship —  but he was tasked with pulling off
   a live broadcast just moments after the Denver Broncos won the Lombardi
   Trophy.

   VIDEOS[89]Beyoncé, Coldplay and Bruno Mars’ Super Bowl Halftime Show —
   Grade It

   Like any real-time television event, Colbert’s post-Super Bowl outing
   suffered a few technical mishaps, particularly when the affable host
   kept asking his producers, “Are we going to commercial or are we going
   to satellite?” at the start of the show (which resulted in a few
   uncomfortable shots of the control room).

   But Sunday’s episode suffered more from segments that simply fell flat,
   for reasons ranging from, “Didn’t they rehearse this interview
   beforehand?” (see: Colbert’s meandering chat with Tina Fey and Margot
   Robbie) to, “What is the point of this?” (see: Will Ferrell forgoing
   all Zoolander 2-related conversation in favor of bringing live animals
   onstage with him).

   That’s not to say the broadcast was without its highlights. Colbert’s
   Super Bowl-themed monologue featured amusing cameos by President Barack
   Obama and FLOTUS Michelle Obama (who were even willing to crack
   jokes about Nicolas Cage’s National Treasure, as one does). And his
   interview with Megyn Kelly was both funny (Trump jokes!) and
   enlightening (redefining feminism!)

   In Between

   All told, though, Colbert had an opportunity on Sunday to show off his
   best work for viewers who are still unfamiliar with “the real him” —
   and we’re not sure he used the hour to his full advantage.

   But that’s just our opinion. What did you think of Colbert’s live Late

       I’ve been disappointed with his entire show and the personality
       change from The Colbert Report. He was more valuable to the
       cultural dialogue as his old character. And funnier.

            He was going to quit the Colbert Report anyway. He said so.
            It’s either this or no Colbert hosting anything. He was tapped
            out. No contribution to the cultural dialogue as you would’ve
            wanted. You’re disappointed in his personality change? To his
            actual personality? Ouch. I think he’s a nice guy and
            naturally quick and funny. He did have writers before that
            came with him so it’s not like you’re not getting everything
            you got in terms of joke writing ability. I like that he has a
            segment in the middle of the guests sometimes. Keeps the
            energy up and gives a shot of Daily Show-esque segments which
            makes sense cuz Stewart’s an EP. I miss the old show, but I
            enjoy what I’m getting. I miss Craig Ferguson too, but
            Corden’s really good on his show. The Nightly Show’s been
            doing some really nice work in Colbert’s old slot. The writing
            on the Late Show’s good even if the guests aren’t all winners.
            Sometimes you gotta deal with people who are there to promote
            something, but they make even the host glaze over a bit.

       It was a bad move for CBS’ part to land The Late Show with Stephen
       Colbert in the post Super Bowl spot if only shows like Scorpion,
       Hawaii Five-O and a few others would have been great candidates for
       that.

            Overwrought? Wow you’re being ridiculous and pretty obviously
            indicating your political leaning. There’s no way it’s
            objectively overwrought for the President to joke around about
            a football for a couple minutes, and it’s sad you can’t
            appreciate something that is more entertaining to people who
            don’t poison it for themselves. Some people so much as see
            Obama in anything and suddenly it’s just ruined forever and
            “in your face.” How dare he appear in front of Cosmos’ first
            episode for example, right? I mean it promotes science in this
            country (besides being exquisitely crafted television) and you
            think that’d be a good thing, but people griped. Then they
            complain that there’s not enough science education–I’m not
            sure how they can expect to make it popular if they put down
            the people who use their leadership positions to celebrate it.
            They complain about obesity and then he and the First Lady
            can’t do anything about sports without getting yelled at. He
            did a fun bit on a late night show and incorporated Michelle’s
            program to get kids to move *after a major sporting event
            where it makes sense to mention athletics.* Just admit your
            agenda. This was fine. He used his position in a world far
            more involved with social media to be in the public eye in a
            light-hearted and educational way, and I don’t see that as a
            bad thing.

                 Holy overreaction, Batman! Nice try, but no. The
                 prerecorded skits with the Obamas simply weren’t funny.
                 They were as wooden as Nixon was in Laugh-In. Now,
                 surely, there is someone on the internet who’s wrong
                 about something else, so please, hurry off, and go make
                 sure they know how you feel. Thanks.

                      Hear hear I do agree. The show was not funny and
                      having Obama and wife on was when I turned it off,
                      it had nothing to do with political view, just not a
                      place for the President.

       You’re making it sound worse than it was, there was plenty of solid
       material, but yeah, more than a couple of glitches too. Some wires
       clearly got crossed somewhere. Reminded me of Fallon’s post
       Superbowl show a year or two ago.

                 I think CBS knows this, but can’t do anything about it
                 for the time being. It’s embarrassing for CBS when the
                 late, late show with Corden is consistently more
                 entertaining than the more hyped Colbert show. I watch
                 Fallon and then switch over to Corden.

       I’m a huge Colbert fan, but man do I really miss the edge and

       still feels way too safe and watered down in comparison.

       James Corden did a MUCH better job with The Late Late Show tonight.
       He should have followed the game. If things keep up at this pace,
       he may well end up taking Colbert’s job.

       I’ll be curious to see what the ratings are for it tomorrow. I know
       it will be high just because of the post game bump, but will be
       interesting to compare it to previous shows. In the past I’ve
       watched whatever was on after the game, but an episode of Colbert
       just wasn’t interesting enough to tune in. I turned the channel as
       soon as the post game stuff was over.

       I personally thought it was great. There was some problems with the
       satellite link, yeah, but you can’t really blame them for that.
       Besides, I always appreciate seeing Paul Dinello! I thought the
       beginning bit with throwing the football worked really well, and I
       loved the meta way they dealt with the pretaped Obama bit. I would
       have loved a bit longer desk segment, because those are generally
       my favourite bits, but I really enjoyed the jokes we did get –
       especially the wall one.
       I thought the Will Ferrell and Key and Peele bits worked very well.
       Especially the K&P one just kept getting better and better –
       although it would have been lovely to actually have Key and Peele
       in the studio. Oh, and that version of Hotline Bling that Jon and
       the band played when Ferrell walked in was amazing.
       I though the Margot Robbie and Tina Fey interview was quite
       charming, although I get if people think that it didn’t fit in on
       such a huge night. Interviewing them separately on different nights
       might have been nice so Tina and Stephen could have gotten into a
       more personal discussion about e.g. second city. Maybe another
       time! The Megyn Kelly interview was also really interesting,
       although I really disagree with her view on feminism.
       It seems like they wanted to keep the show as close to a regular
       episode as possible, albeit with more focus on the guests than
       normally, so people could get a feel for the show, and I think they
       succeeded fairly well with that – although the guest list is
       generally a lot more interesting than it was tonight, imo.

       The stuff with Will Farrell and the animals was absolutely
       hilarious; I laughed the whole time. And they didn’t show the
       control room… it was some stagehand-types off to Colbert’s right,
       beside the stage area. The episode was all-around decent and this
       kind of nitpicking is precisely why so many people ignore what
       critics have to say about television and film.

       I think if you like the new Late Show really depends on what kind
       of late night show you’re looking for. If you want SNL with some
       interviews, the Tonight Show is there for you. You don’t mind
       falling asleep during the interviews because they’re just filler.
       If you want Charlie Rose with some comedy bits tossed in, The Late
       Show is your thing. Colbert is probably the best late night
       interviewer we’ve had in a long time and has promoted people who
       normally wouldn’t even be on these talk shows and made them
       interesting. I can’t stay up that late to watch it live, but when I
       watch the recording the next day I rarely skip through an
       interview. He rarely gives the headliner (almost always a
       celebrity) two segments so he can do a full interview with the
       second guest.
       That said, I think this was his best “comedy” show yet. But the
       Megyn Kelly interview was great too.

            I’m a very political person, but I watch the Sunday morning
            shows for that type of content. I’m not looking for that in a
            late-night show.

       I’m thinking they should bring Letterman back.

       Can the networks stop with the pretense that the post-SB show will
       actually start at 10:00? These days, the game itself doesn’t start
       until well after 6:30, with a longer half-time, and the post-game
       presentation of the trophy, you’re looking at a 10:30 start, at the
       earliest!

       I tuned out after the horrible Obama & dancing rodents skit & was
       asking where Letterman was.

       Since Megyn Kelly was a late entrant to the cast, I have wonder
       what was cut to accommodate her interview. I was upset how they
       handled Key & Peele. Would have loved to have had them in the
       studio. Hmmm. Maybe that was cut.
