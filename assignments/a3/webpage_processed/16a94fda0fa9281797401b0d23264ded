   [21]5 Tips On How To Improve Your #ContentMarketing Strategy With
   #SocialMedia
   This is a guest post by Tess Pajaron.
   It leaves no room for doubt that social media can play a vital role in
   every content marketing strategy. Social networks attract different
   audiences and allow marketers to share their content, promoting it to
   achieve specific goals. It takes experience to fully realize the
   potential of social media for content marketing. Here are 5 tips to
   help you make the most of your content through social networks.

1. Share your content more than once

   If you think you risk your audience getting bored with what you've got
   to offer, think twice. Sharing the same content more than once isn't
   dangerous at all – it will maximize its visibility and drive more
   traffic. Remember, to your new followers, a piece posted 3 months ago
   will seem new.
   Another thing to consider is the fact that your audience might be
   spread across different time zones – posting several times, you'll make
   sure that your content reaches people in all geographical locations and
   with different social media habits.

   Here's how a social media editorial calendar worked on Twitter alone to
   get 3,150% more traffic.

2. Measure reactions to your content

   Add a special hashtag to every post – [24]it will later allow you to
   listen and see how people talk about your brand and content. Thanks to
   this hashtag, you'll be able to track these conversations and learn
   what to change in order for your content to be more thought provoking
   and shareable.

3. Target specific audience

   In the world of content marketing, this holds true – the more specific
   you get, the more consistent your brand will appear. Targeting a
   defined audience will save you a lot of trouble – you'll be addressing
   people who are really interested in what you have to say.
   One way to do this is to share your content to niche social networks.
   They might not boast audiences like the social media giants, but
   they're already engaged in your topic – you won't need to segment them
   and find a way to promote your content so it reaches the right people.
   Take a look at this infographic from [25]Sprinklr and learn how you can
   reach your target audience on social media.

4. Optimize your messages for different types of social networks

   It's important to be aware that every social network has unique
   qualities and attracts slightly different kinds of audiences. By
   ignoring the specific character of social networks, you'll only make
   sure that your content won't get liked and shared by users.
   Optimizing your messages, you'll drastically improve your chances at
   actually making your content resonate with your audience. Bear in mind
   that Twitter favors short and powerful messages complemented with
   images, and on Google+ you'll better aim for engagement than simply
   posting your content – at least [27]according to Hootsuite.
   When it comes to Facebook, you should test what works for your
   audience. Some claim that photos are essential for a post's success and
   others point out that asking for shares or likes is actually
   counterproductive. Find out what works for each social network and
   cater to the preferences of your audience.

5. Social networks A/B testing

   Posting your content multiple times is not only great for exposure – it
   also allows you to test which headlines are most attractive and work
   best for your audience. Create two headlines for tweeting your content,
   tweet them at roughly the same time (one hour apart works fine) and
   later compare the data collected on each tweet.
   Some basic social analytics will help you to find out which headlines
   work better – doing this simple comparison, you'll instantly see which
   posts got more attention (clicks, favorites, likes) and hold more
   potential.
   When it comes to content marketing, social media is indispensable – it
   not only helps marketers to better understand their target audience,
   but also provides a whole wealth of analytics tools to measure the
   response to content, suggesting possible improvements in making it
   resonate more with the audience.
