For Super Bowl, Audi says astronauts will love its car

   Retired spacemen can get depressed. Until, that is, they get behind the
   wheel of Audi's R8 V10 Plus. At least that's what Audi wants you to
   believe.

   Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's
   taken over our lives.
     __________________________________________________________________

   With any luck, he won't make the jump to hyperspace when you're in the
   crosswalk.

   Audi; YouTube screenshot by CNET

   Once you've been into space, returning to Earth must feel like
   returning to a comfortable open prison.

   Nothing excites you in quite the same way anymore. Earthlings seem so
   mundane.

   But that's merely because most of them design cars that have all the
   excitement of a live C-SPAN debate on the subject of the color beige.

   No, those aren't my opinions. They're merely my extrapolations after
   watching [121]Audi's Super Bowl ad.

   This concoction places us in the mind of a retired astronaut who sits
   at home, surrounded by his past.

   IFRAME: [122]https://www.youtube.com/embed/yB8tgVqmKzw

   His son arrives. His son calls him "Commander." This is not an ordinary
   family.

   Immediately, son knows how to cure dad's depression. He gets him into a
   Audi R8 V10 Plus.

     * [125]GPS spelling mistake sends American the wrong way, and onto TV

   One has to assume that the son has just bought this car. Otherwise,
   he's a little slow on the uptake. It's surely obvious that the R8 is
   almost identical to some Apollo rocket.

   Of course, David Bowie's "Starman" is the backdrop for this intimate
   yet dynamic tale.

   Will this be the ad that rises above the star-filled morass of other
   Super Bowl ads vying for your attention? Or is this the only way that
   Audi feels it can rise above the depression of its own brand?

   This has been caused by its involvement in an emissions scandal that
   sees it, together with parent Volkswagen, perhaps in the position of
   [126]even buying back many of its cars from customers.

   For Audi, this ad is "a universal reminder that amazing things happen
   when we choose exploration, technology and the moon."

   Yes, but what about Mars? Oh, wait. Mars [127]is Tesla's thing.

Did the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge get leaked by Samsung?

   A video on the web has people everywhere hoping the next Galaxy phone
   will be waterproof. Meanwhile, Tidal becomes the number one app on
   Apple's US app store.
