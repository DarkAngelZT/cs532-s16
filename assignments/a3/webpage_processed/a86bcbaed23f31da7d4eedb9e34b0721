How does mPLUS Rewards work?

   mPLUS Rewards is a loyalty program used by hundreds of leading mobile
   apps to reward their users as a "thank you" for staying active with
   their content. Earn points just for completing in-app activities like
   tracking a run or finishing a game level. You can even earn points for
   engaging with in-app advertising. Then redeem all those points for
   awesome rewards!

What kinds of rewards?

   Rewards include gift cards to Amazon.com or Starbucks and fun
   merchandise like a Google Chromecast or a FitBit Activity Tracker. You
   can even make charitable donations to leading non-profit organizations
   like St. Jude Children's Hospital or the ASPCA.
