Manchester City v Chelsea: What we learnt at the Etihad

Five things that became clearer during 1-1 draw between Premier League title
rivals

   Eliaquim Mangala - Manchester City v Chelsea: What we learnt
   Perfect partner: Eliaquim Mangala tackles Diego Costa during an

   1. Mangala passes his test

   There have been times in recent weeks when the absence of Eliaquim
   Mangala from Manuel Pellegrini’s team has raised questions about why
   £32m was spent to sign the FC Porto defender this summer. But after
   being handed a daunting debut against Chelsea, the French centre-half
   dispelled any doubts over his abilities by producing a hugely
   encouraging performance alongside Vincent Kompany. City captain Kompany
   has never enjoyed the luxury of an established partner at the Etihad,
   but the 23-year-old Mangala has pace, an imposing frame and is
   comfortable on the ball. Their shared qualities suggest City may have
   new Rio Ferdinand-Nemanja Vidic pairing in the making.

   2. Nothing new for Roy Hodgson

   This was undoubtedly a clash between England’s best two teams, but it
   was anything but a showcase for English talent. Only four Englishmen
   started the game, with the number available to Roy Hodgson reduced to
   three with John Terry no longer available for the international team.
   Another England retiree, Frank Lampard, was the only domestic player on
   either substitutes’ bench. The Premier League has long been the most
   cosmopolitan league in world football, but after England’s World Cup
   horror show, the presence of just three Englishmen among the 22
   starters in this battle for supremacy offers a worrying glimpse into
   the future.

   3. Costa contributes when not scoring

       21 Sep 2014

   After helping himself to six goals in four Premier League games
   following his summer arrival from Atlético Madrid, facing Manchester
   City captain Vincent Kompany was the acid test for Diego Costa. The
   prolific new-boy against the Premier League’s best defender and it was
   a titanic tussle from start to finish, with both players giving as good
   as they got. Kompany prevented Costa from scoring, but the Spaniard was
   a constant menace, linking play for his team and starting the move
   which led to Schurrle’s goal. City tried to trigger his suspect
   temperament, but Costa kept his head, with Zabaleta earning a red card
   for a second-half foul on the striker.

   4. It is a Blue chip title challenge

   The season may only be a month old, but the evidence from this game
   suggested that the title race will be contested only by the blues of
   Manchester and west London.

   Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham might still harbour ambitions of
   challenging for the title, but while all three have their flaws, City
   and Chelsea proved that they are both formidable in every department.
   Good defending appears to have become a forgotten art, but both
   defences displayed resolve and organisation until City were compromised
   by the dismissal of Pablo Zabaleta five minutes before André Schürrle’s
   goal for Chelsea.

   5. Lampard still too good for the MLS

   There was a certain element of inevitability when Frank Lampard, seven
   minutes after replacing Aleksandar Kolarov, broke into the penalty area
   to score from James Milner’s cross. Chelsea had benefited from
   Lampard’s peerless ability to score from midfield for more than a
   decade, so it was ironic that he claimed his first City goal against
   the club he served with distinction for so long. With the 36-year-old
   midfielder signing a deal with New York City FC in Major League Soccer,
   his loan at the Etihad Stadium will last for only half a season, but he
   showed enough in 13 minutes in this game to suggest that he is heading
   Stateside too soon.
