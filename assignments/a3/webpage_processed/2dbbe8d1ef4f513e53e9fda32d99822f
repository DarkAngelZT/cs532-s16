   Published on Dec 9, 2013

   George Foster says the potential for wealth creation in the field of
   sports entrepreneurship has been vastly underestimated. But he warns
   that sports industry fortunes can fall as quickly as they rise, and
   gives advice to aspiring sports entrepreneurs on how to avoid common
   mistakes. He is professor of management at Stanford Graduate School of
   Business where he teaches sports management, entrepreneurship, and
   finance. He works closely with the Stanford Athletic Department in
   recruiting and advising student athletes, and directs the NFL-Stanford
   Executive Program.
