Was Peyton Manning's game versus Panthers the worst for a Super Bowl-winning
QB? Not quite

   Minutes after Peyton Manning captured his second Super Bowl, the
   perfect ending to a Hall of Fame career, the Denver Broncos quarterback
   told CBS reporter Tracy Wolfson that the game, a 24-10 victory, had
   been much like Denver's season as a whole.

   Manning wasn't very good. The Broncos defense was incredible, carrying
   the load for a sputtering offense. As the game winded down, it became
   clear that Denver's best offensive approach was to run three times and
   get the defense back on the field.

   Manning's final stat line wasn't pretty: 13-for-23, 141 yards, zero
   touchdowns, one interception and a lost fumble. He finished with a 56.6
   passer rating, nearly 20 points lower than his passer rating in the
   43-8 massacre against Seattle two years ago.

   Statistically, this wasn't the worst performance by a Super
   Bowl-winning quarterback. Three players have won a Super Bowl with a
   lower passer rating.

   Super Bowl XL: Ben Roethlisberger, 22.6 passer rating
   The Steelers beat the Seahawks despite Roethlisberger's 9-for-21,
   123-yard, two-interception game. They got a boost on a 43-yard
   touchdown pass from receiver Antwaan Randle-El to Hines Ward.

   Super Bowl XXXII: John Elway, 51.9 passer rating
   Elway's stat line in his first Super Bowl win was nearly identical to
   Manning's Sunday: 12-for-22, 123 yards, no touchdowns and one
   interception. Elway was aided by a monster ground game, though. Terrell
   Davis had 157 rushing yards and three touchdowns in the win over the
   Packers.
   Super Bowl V: Earl Morrall, 54.0 passer rating
   This one is a little different. Morrall replaced an injured Johnny
   Unitas, who was 3-for-9 for 88 yards, one touchdown and a pair of
   interceptions. Morrall went 7-for-15 for 147 yards and a pick. The
   Baltimore Colts still prevailed, 16-13, over Dallas.
