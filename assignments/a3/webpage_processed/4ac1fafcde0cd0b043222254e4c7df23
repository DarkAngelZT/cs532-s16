   [33]Super Bowl Big Plays

It wasn’t just the powers of superstar quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Cam
Newton that made Super Bowl 50 a great game. In fact, the best plays were
actually made by the defense! Check out five monumental plays from this
year’s Super Bowl right here!

   What do you get when your defense turns up? A [35]Super Bowl victory!
   The [36]Denver Broncos D-squad was on fire at Levi’s Stadium
   during Super Bowl 50, making some of the most crucial plays to lead the
   team to a [37]24-10 win over the [38]Carolina Panthers. Broncos outside
   linebacker [39]Von Miller may have received MVP recognition for his
   incredible strip sacks, but there were definitely a few other plays
   that deserved to be honored too!

   Von had not one, but TWO strip sacks on [40]Cam Newton in his
   outstanding Super Bowl performance, with the first happening in the
   first quarter to give the Broncos an early 10-0 lead. After taking the
   ball right out of Cam’s hands, the ball bounced right into the end zone
   and was recovered by Malik Jackson for a touchdown — the first Super
   Bowl touchdown from a fumble recovery in 22 years!

   Then, to [41]declare his MVP status, Von stripped Cam once again with
   four minutes to go in the game. The ball shot back to the 4-yard line,
   where T.J. Ward picked it up to give the Broncos the ball. The Broncos
   were only up by 6 at that point, so Von’s play wasn’t just epic…it was
   crucial! Watch it below!

   It wasn’t just Von who had a big game, though. Wide receiver Jordan
   Norwood of the Broncos made a huge 61-yard punt return that allowed for
   the Broncos to get a field goal and take them up 13-7. Not to mention,
   Jordan’s play set a record for the longest punt return in Super Bowl
   history!

   Although the Broncos were victorious in Super Bowl 50, the Panthers’
   [48]Luke Kuechly had a major hit that was one of the biggest in the
   game. In the second quarter, Luke hit [49]Demaryius Thomas so hard that
   the ball flew right out of the wide receiver’s hands! The Panthers
   couldn’t do anything with it, but Luke certainly made headlines for his
   tackle!

   But while all of these incredible plays were being made, Broncos
   cornerback Aqib Talib had a rather controversial play that put the
   Broncos in some trouble in the second quarter. Aqib had a nasty
   facemask penalty called on him that put the Panthers in scoring
   position and eventually allowed a touchdown to put them back in the
   game 10-7. In the end, the Broncos recovered from the scoring threat,
   and they proved to be the champions. Even though [51]Peyton Manning
   wasn’t the man with the big plays on Feb. 7, with plays like Von’s and
   Jordan’s, we totally see how the Broncos were victorious!

   Which play would you declare the most monumental of Super Bowl 50,
   HollywoodLifers? Do you think the Broncos deserved to win? Tell us
   below!
