Clash of The Titans : It's Hillary Clinton Versus Sanders!

   Hillary and Sanders fight over issues like arms, health care etc.
   Hillary Clinton clinched on to President Barack Obama's political
   legacy on Sunday, looking to stop a late surge by adversary Bernie
   Sanders, as wild conflicts over weapons, medicinal services and Wall
   Street tore through the Democratic presidential open deliberation.
   [75][Hillary-Clinton-min.jpg]
   With Sanders undermining to miracle Clinton in the initial two
   selecting challenges one month from now, the previous secretary of
   state tried to slow down his energy, cut his dynamic certifications and
   bring up issues about whether the self-announced communist has the
   right stuff and experience to be president.
   She utilized the last civil argument before voting begins in Iowa and
   New Hampshire to present a defense to reliable supporters of Obama, who
   some Clinton associates stress may move to Sanders. She'll need them to
   manufacture a triumphant coalition fit for winning the Democratic
   selection and mounting an effective race in the general election.
   "I am going to defend President Obama for taking on Wall Street, taking
   on the finance industry and getting results," is what Mrs Hillary
   Clinton had to say.
   Sanders, then, was significantly more at home in lashing out at Clinton
   than in his past verbal confrontation experiences, and the night in
   Charleston, South Carolina, was outstanding more for individual
   conflicts between them as opposed to assaults on Republicans. He hit
   back at Clinton by demanding that Obama was his companion and took a
   swipe at Clinton over the lucrative months she spent on the talking
   circuit after she exited the State Department.
   "I don't take money from big banks, I don't get personal speaking fees
   from Goldman Sachs," is how Sanders expressed his feelings.
   In any case, for all the energy and raised voices, it appeared to be
   improbable that either Clinton or Sanders changed the element of their
   race, which makes them battle without holding back in the initial two
   states.
   Late surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire likewise indicate Clinton in an
   undeniably dubious position. A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics
   review had Clinton up only two focuses in the Hawkeye State a week ago.
   A study by Monmouth University in the Granite State a week ago had
   Sanders ahead by 14 focuses.
   Clinton still holds a summoning lead over Sanders broadly. Another
   NBC/Wall Street Journal national survey on Sunday demonstrated Clinton
   driving Sanders 59% to 34%, with the third hopeful in the race,
   previous Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, at 2%.
   Clinton's technique on Sunday included clasping Obama as close as
   possible, unexpectedly in a state where she conflicted severely with
   the President amid the 2008 battle. After eight years, African-American
   voters in the state could now give a firewall against Sanders' ascent.
