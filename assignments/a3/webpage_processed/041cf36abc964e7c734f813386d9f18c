   The Denver Broncos defense were number 1 in the league in a number of
   different categories. They were the best defense in all of football for
   the entire season and they lived up to those expectations in Super Bowl
   50. Von Miller saved one of his best performances for the big stage.
   Miller started the party early for the Broncos when he was able to
   strip Cam Newton which led to a Broncos touchdown. From there the
   Broncos never looked back. The team was able to pressure Cam Newton all
   night long whether it was Demarcus Ware on a sack, or Derek Wolfe on
   half a sack. In fact the Broncos pass rushing efforts were so good they
   recorded 7 sacks as a team. The cool demeanor of Cam Newton was
   replaced by frustration and lack of comfort. As Wade Phillips called
   blitz after blitz and let the Broncos secondary stick their receivers
   man to man. There were countless number of times the Panthers tried to
   rush up the middle only to have the Broncos defense engulf the play
   immediately. Malik Jackson also added a defense touchdown to Denver’s
   defensive contributions as well when he fell on Millers stripped fumble
   early on. At the end of the day Denver’s key player was Von Miller
   though. It can’t be stated enough how much of an impact he truly had in
   this game. He finished the evening with 6 tackles, 2 and a half sacks,
   and 2 hits on the quarterback. That is why he finished the game as the
   Most Value Player. Without Miller it would of been much tougher for the
   Broncos. On one particular play Miller worked a textbook spin move
   against Panthers tackle Mike Remmers and finished the play by taking
   down Newton. There were plays like that all night long that swung the
   momentum in Denver’s favor. They came out and backed it up on the
   biggest stage. They earned their respect and deserve to be Super Bowl
   champions.
