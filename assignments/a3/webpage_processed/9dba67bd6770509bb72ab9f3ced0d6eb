   SANTA CLARA, Calif. — Von Miller blew around Carolina Panthers right
   tackle Mike Remmers, and Cam Newton couldn’t feel him coming. That
   Miller walloped Newton from his blind side was one thing, but it was
   what happened next that showed why Miller is the NFL’s next major
   defensive star.

   Miller wrestled the ball out of Newton’s arms, springing it free and
   rolling it toward the end zone, where teammate Malik Jackson corralled
   it for a touchdown.

   That play showed the speed, power and swagger that epitomized the
   Denver Broncos defense all season.

   But no one was more important to it, or to Denver’s defensive effort in
   its 24-10 win against the Panthers in Super Bowl 50, than Miller, the
   Broncos’ dirty-dancing, fur hat-wearing, bespectacled sack master, who
   now can add Super Bowl MVP to his résumé.

   Armour: Broncos defense comes up big as Manning leaves the field a
   champion

   Miller finished Super Bowl 50 with 2½ sacks, including two that
   resulted in fumbles, and six total tackles. Far from taking credit, he
   heaped praise on his teammates.

   "It feels great," he said. "We have been working for two years. Me and
   my teammates and all my guys. This is what you work for. I am so proud
   of my buddies. I am so proud of my teammates and coaches.

   "It just shows what type of team we have. It is not about the offense,
   defense or special teams. ... We have a lot of love for each other, and
   that is where the success comes from."

   He craved this matchup vs. Newton, the only player drafted ahead of him
   in 2011. Although Miller was diplomatic leading up to the game
   regarding his respect for Newton — that respect seems genuine — he so
   wanted to have his biggest game on the NFL’s grandest stage.

   Bell: Peyton Manning gets help to write possible storybook end

   That was clear when he did Newton’s signature dance, the Dab, over
   Newton after that epic strip sack.

   "Von might be the most unblockable dude in the game," Denver running
   back C.J. Anderson said.

   Miller already has earned a reputation as one of the NFL’s elite
   defensive players thanks to 60 sacks in his first five seasons, despite
   missing seven games in 2013 because of suspension and injury. This
   postseason has truly been his coming-out party, and Miller is about to
   cash in.

   In back-to-back playoff games against the New England Patriots, against
   whom he had 2½ sacks and an interception, and the Super Bowl, where he
   had 2½ more sacks, Miller showed why he can’t just be lumped in with
   the NFL’s other best pass rushers, and why the Broncos will have to
   give him a contract in excess of $100 million.

   "He's a great football player, and we knew that when we drafted him.
   He's as talented as anyone I've ever seen in what he can do," Broncos
   general manager John Elway said. "I think that he's just continued to
   play big in big games, especially the last three or four games, he's
   just been tremendous.

   "I'm thrilled for Von, and for him to make those plays, it wins the
   football game for us."

   How the Broncos bet big on stopping Cam Newton and won

   Miller is a true linebacker and is asked to drop back in pass coverage
   or play run defense on the edge as much as he’s sent chasing
   quarterbacks. In the AFC Championship Game, his interception came as he
   dropped back into a zone to cover Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski. In
   the Super Bowl, he was sent deep to cover wide receiver Jerricho
   Cotchery on a post route. Do any other pass rushers do that?

   Or how about the unique way defensive coordinator Wade Phillips chose
   to use Miller early in the game, to spy the elusive Newton as a way to
   try to slow the Panthers’ option offense?

   "I call him a Super Freak. Some of the things he does are super
   freakish," Broncos defensive end Antonio Smith said. "The way he bends
   around that corner, sometimes it’s like the tackle never even touches
   him."

   Miller had another strip sack in the fourth quarter, deep in Panthers’
   territory, which set up the Broncos’ only offensive touchdown.

   John Elway repays Broncos owner Pat Bowlen with postgame tribute

   "Peyton (Manning) and DeMarcus (Ware) and coach Phillips and all the
   guys that have been deserving their whole, whole career, I did this for
   them," Miller said. "I put my neck on the line for those guys."

   He now heads into an offseason in which he will almost certainly
   receive the Broncos’ franchise tag unless a long-term deal is reached
   by early March. In that  scenario, he and the team would then have a
   few months to work out a long-term deal.

   "Obviously we're going to try to work something out with Von. We want
   Von to stay in Denver, and we're going to do everything we can to work
   it out," Elway said.

   What Miller showed Sunday is he’s going to be worth it.
