   Hey guys iSpiteful here bringing you another Halo 5 Custom map. This is
   Jenga Tower by UnknownEmerald. This version takes inspiration to the
   one we saw in halo 4. In this Jenga all but one player will go onto the
   red team. The one blue player will spawn with a phaeton and reds on top
   of the huge tower made up of containers. The phaeton has to knock down
   the tower by using its short power boost to slam into the containers
   and push them out. This will make the tower unsteady or even make it
   collapse. To defend themselves each player on the red team has 2
   splinter grenades that can be used as EMPs to disable the phaeton and
   they also have the ability to hijack which is an instant round win. The
   round will end if all red players have been knocked off the tower, the
   phaeton is disabled and flipped on the floor or the phaeton is
   hijacked. When i heard this map had been made in halo 5 i just could
   not wait to get my hands on it and play. I played hours upon hours of
   Jenga tower in Halo 4 and this game just brought all the great memories
   back.
   This map is incredible, i had so much fun playing and it is a map that
   i can not recommend more for you to download and play, you will enjoy
   it without a doubt. So i hope you enjoy the gameplay i have provided
   and as
   always i will see you next video! Peace!
   -iSpiteful
