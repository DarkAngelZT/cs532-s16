THE CHOICE

   Studio: Lionsgate presents a Nicholas Sparks / Safran Company / POW!
   production
   Opening February 5, 2016
   Rated PG13
   choice

About the Movie:

   When feisty medical student Gabby Holland moves in next door to
   perennial ladies’ man Travis Shaw, they embark on a surprising romantic
   journey neither imagined possible. Travis has always believed a serious
   relationship would cramp his easygoing lifestyle, while Gabby is
   preparing to settle down with her long-term boyfriend—until an
   irresistible attraction between the unlikely couple upends both of
   their well-planned lives. Spanning a decade and tracing the evolution
   of a love affair that is ultimately tested by life’s most defining
   events, this story features a memorable ensemble of friends and family
   in Sparks’s beloved North Carolina setting, culminating
   with the question that every couple must ask themselves: how far would
   you go to keep the hope of love alive?
