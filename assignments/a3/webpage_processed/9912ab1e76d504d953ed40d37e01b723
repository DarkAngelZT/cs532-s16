Sarcastic Punk Hopes Peyton Manguy Scores 30 Home Runs at Sports Ball
Championship

   SAN FRANCISCO – Facebook friends of local punk Jeff Lewis report they
   were “thoroughly amused” by a recent post in which he stated he will be
   rooting for the “Denmark Horsies” and hopes “Peyton Manguy scores 30
   home run shots” in today’s Super Bowl.

   Lewis, a 24-year-old record store clerk, has countered any excitement
   about the Super Bowl coming to the Bay Area by showcasing his trademark
   wit in his Facebook and Twitter feeds, which has left his equally
   cynical friends beside themselves with joy.

   “Jeff is just going at everybody, and it is some of the funniest stuff
   I have ever seen,” said long-time friend Julie Cranbauer. “The other
   day, he said ‘I hope Fig Newton gets a slam dunk in the first period’ —
   when I saw that, I realized he is working on a higher level comedically
   than most people.”

   With the kickoff to the Super Bowl fast approaching, Lewis has found
   himself working double time to properly comment on any posts regarding
   sports that come through his feed.

   “I am not going to waste my life away watching some overpaid
   billionaires play a game for kids. I have much better things to do,”
   said Lewis as he took a much-needed break from updating his Twitter
   feed. “It’s bad enough I can’t ride my bike down Market Street without
   all these sportsball fan douchers spilling their Coors Light all over
   me. My time is too valuable. You won’t catch me in front of a
   television all day hoping that someone grand slams a three pointer or
   whatever.”

   However, not everyone is pleased with Lewis’s snarky brand of humor.
   Former coworker Lance Appleby condemned the intentional ignorance Lewis
   has been spouting.

   “I asked if anyone wanted to come over to watch the big game, and Jeff
   comments with this bullshit about how he hopes ‘the goalie wins the
   race for the wicket at the bowling alley;’ that isn’t even funny. It is
   just words that vaguely resemble sports terms,” said Appleby through a
   clenched jaw. “For a guy that supposedly hates sports so much, he’s
   pretty much mastered the jock attitude.”

   Update: Lewis has reportedly made plans with friends to watch the game
   and make fun of everyone who takes it seriously and tries to enjoy
   themselves. Anonymous sources have confirmed, however, that Lewis is
   unironically excited for the commercials.
