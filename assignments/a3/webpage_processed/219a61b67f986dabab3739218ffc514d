   ___________
   A video game takes up more of our time than movies, TV, or books, but
   they have far less to say. Literally: while TV scripts have about 120
   words per minute of dialogue, we timed several narrative heavy games at
   about 16 words per minute. Many of those words are aimed at giving the
   player game information, not plot exposition, but even so, games like
   Destiny waste the time they do have on instructional text or throwaway
   lines. Characters simply restate what's going on around them or make
   meaningless comments to cover the gap in boring sections of gameplay.
   Contrast that with the Witcher 3, which dispenses instructions in five
   words and then proceeds to tell a story. Good dialogue should meet at
   least one of four basic criteria: 1) Tells us about the world 2) Tells
   us about the speaker 3) Tells us about other characters, or 4) Moves
   the plot forward. When games have so few words to build their story,
   it's a shame to see those opportunities wasted on filler.
