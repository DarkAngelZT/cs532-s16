ZIRX Drops Its Consumer Valet Service To Focus On The Enterprise

   [508468758.jpg?w=738]

   David Ordal Crunch Network Contributor

   David Ordal is the chief executive of [86]Everbooked, an Airbnb booking
   analysis company.
   [87]How to join the network

   As Super Bowl 50 draws near, some Airbnb hosts are hoping for a
   substantial payout. Crazy listings are popping up – this home is going
   for [88]$6000 a night.

   If that’s out of your price range, how about sharing a room for only
   [89]$1300 per night?

   The thought process seems solid – [90]an estimated million people
   descending on the already housing-strained San Francisco Bay area. With
   such high profile demand, the obvious conclusion hike prices sky-high,
   and hope for a big payday. But will hosts get it?

     Maybe I should AirBnB out my spare bedroom for $1000 per night for
     Superbowl weekend. Minimum 3 night stay.

     — William Diaz (@ProgressingSF) [91]January 29, 2016

     Wondering how to turn my office into a spare bedroom to rent out on
     AirBNB for the SuperBowl.

     — Meghan Currier (@MeghanCurrier) [92]January 26, 2016

   superbowl2

Conventional Wisdom is Too Conventional

   Probably not — let’s take a look at the data. In Santa Clara, where
   Levi’s Stadium resides, the average Airbnb price for booked rooms is
   only up 25% compared to nearby weekends. How can this be?

   The answer lies in the good ol’ laws of supply and demand — unlike
   hotel rooms, the supply of sharing economy accommodations is elastic –
   the higher the price (or perceived price) goes, the more people put a
   place on the market. In the case of Santa Clara, there are 86% more
   Airbnbs listed for Super Bowl weekend than the surrounding weekends.
   There are so many properties available, that there’s actually excess
   supply for Super Bowl weekend, which has put a cap on the additional
   revenue a host could make.

   Bay Area wide, the trend is the same. In only the past three months,
   Airbnb hosts with only one listing have grown from 9,627 to 13,732 – an
   increase of  42%. This elasticity is hidden from a would-be Airbnb host
   – if exposed, it may make people think twice about asking for crazy
   rents.

   superbowl1

The Implications of Elastic Supply

   Never before have we seen such an elastic supply, and it’s further
   evidence of the fundamental shift that our broader economy is going
   through.
   Before Airbnb, Uber, and Lyft, you couldn’t just build more hotel rooms
   or put more taxis on the street. Supply was constrained, and you paid
   for it either via sky high prices (hotel rooms) or long wait times
   (taxis).
   Although there isn’t a lot of evidence that the increase in Airbnb
   supply has had an effect on hotel prices for this event, in the long
   run, it surely will.
   As more and more people using Airbnb (and similar services), peak
   demand for hotels will be moderated, and with it, their prices. It may
   not be a future that many hotel revenue managers want to face, but it’s
   a future that most consumers will surely enjoy.
