   SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- As [18]Panthers quarterback [19]Cam Newton
   approached the interview podium following [20]the Panthers' 24-10 loss
   to the [21]Broncos in [22]Super Bowl 50, he was being watched by a pair
   of friends fully aware of how disheartened he was.

   The league's Most Valuable Player settled into his uncomfortable
   interview chair, arms at his side with the hood of his sweatshirt
   swooped over his head. At the same time, offensive coordinator Mike
   Shula and quarterbacks coach Ken Dorsey were trying to get his
   attention a few yards to Newton's left.

   Shula, standing on another podium, appeared to be signaling to his
   quarterback one last time this season. He looked to be motioning to
   Newton, asking him to remove his hood. Shula, eyes directly at the
   quarterback, made the motion a few times before trying to listen in.

   Newton did not abide. Newton was also probably not looking. This was
   painful and he wanted it to end quickly.

   "We lost," Newton said when asked if he could put the disappointment
   into words.

   "Nope," he said, when asked if there was anything in particular about
   the game he could remember.

   "They just played better than us," he added. "I don't know what you
   want me to say, I'm sorry. They made more plays than us, and that's
   what it came down to. We had opportunities. It wasn't nothing special
   that they did. We dropped balls, we turned the ball over, gave up
   sacks, threw errant passes. That's it, they scored more points than
   us."

   The whole thing lasted around two and a half minutes. Newton walked by
   his coaches on the way back to his locker stall.

   This will go down as an all-out indictment of the [23]Panthers
   quarterback, but before taking aim, consider why his coaches were there
   in the first place. Was Newton being immature and petulant, or, after a
   season where he redefined what it meant to be a mobile quarterback, was
   he just that upset?

   Was he thumbing his nose at the same people who criticized his dancing,
   celebratory attitude and frankness when it comes to race in sports? Or
   was he simply trying to process what he'd seen -- an anomaly during a
   season where the [24]Panthers almost went undefeated in the regular
   season.

   Having a coordinator and position coach watch a player at his post-game
   press conference is a fairly unusual occurrence, especially in the
   chaotic, wide-open warehouse setting of a [25]Super Bowl interview
   session.

   All season long, we've heard about how close the quarterback room was.
   We've heard how revolutionary Shula was, and how Dorsey was a rising
   star in the business. And maybe that's why they knew Newton would be at
   rock bottom. They knew him that well.

   "As hard as it will be, you have to remember the good things we've
   done," Shula said.

   He added: "I think that, like I said, there are differences that are so
   little at the end of each and every game, each and every play. Field
   position, momentum, things like that. But you have to find a way to be
   on the plus side of that."

   At his own podium session, Shula talked slowly. He closed his eyes for
   extended periods of time and he tried his best to remember the good
   times, perhaps foreshadowing Newton's press conference to come. He has
   been through this before and he grew up in a football family. He knew
   that in order to avoid a character assassination that there's a painful
   delicacy to these things, no matter how unfair the rapid-fire
   questioning of a magnanimous loss is.

   Newton, who passed for 3,837 total yards, ran and passed for 45 total
   touchdowns and threw just 10 interceptions this season, showed us a
   different way to do things this season. And being upset about one bad
   night -- Newton went 18-41 for 265 yards and an interception in the
   face of a historically relentless [26]Broncos pass rush  shouldn't
   change things.

   Shula and Dorsey certainly didn't want it to.
