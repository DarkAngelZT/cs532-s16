Cam Newton bolts Super Bowl news conference after terse exchanges

   Cam Newton didn't say much to the media following the Panthers loss in

   SANTA CLARA, Calif. – A devastated Cam Newton walked out of his
   post-Super Bowl 50 media conference, unable to mask his disappointment
   at the Carolina Panthers’ 24-10 defeat to the Denver Broncos.

   Newton looked shell-shocked in the locker room in the immediate
   aftermath of the contest and was barely able to give a coherent answer
   after making his way around Levi’s Stadium to the Panthers’ central
   media podium.

   What followed was an odd exchange where Newton declined to answer
   several questions in a two-minute session that was in some ways
   reminiscent of Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch’s press
   silence a year ago.

   The 26-year-old quarterback was first asked if Denver had done anything
   unexpected to counterbalance his offensive threat.

   “Nothing different,” Newton mumbled.

   How the Broncos bet big on stopping Cam Newton and won

   Next he was asked if the Broncos’ win was proof that great defenses
   have the ability to stifle even the most potent offense. Newton
   responded with a stare and shrug.

   When quizzed as to what head coach Ron Rivera had told his team after
   the match, Newton was no more forthcoming. “(Coach) told us lots of
   things,” Newton said.

   After two more questions were met with nothing audible in the way of
   reaction, Newton finally gave his only complete answer.

   “They just played better than us,” Newton said, when asked to put his
   disappointment into words. “They made more plays than us and that’s
   what it came down to. We had our opportunities.

   Rogers: Cam Newton's dazzling season fizzles against tough Broncos'
   defense

   “It weren’t nothing special that they did. We dropped balls, we turned
   the ball over, gave up sacks, threw errant passes, that’s it. We lost.”

   That was as talkative as Newton got, and when he was asked about what
   sympathy he had for his teammates, he simply stood without a word, left
   the podium and retreated to the locker room.

   Soon after, he walked slowly through the bowels of the arena, climbed
   onto the Carolina team bus, and slouched into the front seat.

   The effervescent, electrifying figure that was seen for most of the
   season was gone. A long off-season of soul-searching had begun.
