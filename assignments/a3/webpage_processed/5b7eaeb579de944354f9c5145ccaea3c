The 2016 SuperBowl -the game, the ads, the halftime show- was
profoundly okay.

February 8, 2016

   Gaga did good…

   Outside of picture-perfect weather and a truly beautiful performance of
   our National Anthem by Lady Gaga, little about the Super Bowl was
   amazing.

   Unless you’re a fan of crushing defense (which is something),
   everything about the game was… okay. It was a sloppy, penalty-ridden
   affair, periodically fun to watch and technically competitive. The
   score was close. Both defenses were good. Denver’s was outstanding.
   Peyton Manning “The Sheriff” got to ride off into the sunset with a
   Super Bowl win. He’d be insane to come back. But staying home and
   making hokey commercials could easily drive him back onto the field. I
   don’t care one way or the other. Do you? Sometimes nice guys don’t
   finish last.

   So that was the football. What about the rest of it i.e. the
   commercials and the halftime show? Again, the word “okay.” Coldplay,
   Beyonce and Bruno Mars were slick, watchable and, frankly, forgettable.
   Folks in the Bay Area grumbled that it should have been local artists,
   Metallica that did the show. According to reviews, the band killed it
   “The Night Before” at AT&T park. This would have to suffice as the only
   controversy surrounding the halftime show. Given the NFL’s tumultuous
   year (concussions, deflated footballs, domestic violence), I’m sure
   they were delighted by an “okay” show.

   The advertising had no outstanding entries, excellent or terrible. Lots
   of celebrities and talking animals. Again. The “Wiener Dog” commercial
   for Heinz was cute. An Audi spot had the added gravitas of featuring
   David Bowie in its soundtrack. Jeep gave us a nifty hashtag with
   #4x4ever delivered on the back of a rambling anthem for their vehicles.
   Doritos iconic triangles were sky-written across San Francisco’s azure
   skies. Clever. There was a dancing monkey-human baby. Whatever.

   Not just dogs – wiener dogs!

   Honestly, I was somewhat bummed there were no truly awful commercials,
   though the preponderance of bizarre medicine spots grated. I mean a
   stomach puppet? Honorable mention for sucky goes to the specious
   argument put forward by Scientology –something about it being the
   intersection of spirituality and technology. Scientology is neither.
   Still, the commercial came and went. Hating on it more would be like
   beating a dead horse.

   All in all, the SuperBowl was damn okay.

       This actually summed up my thoughts exactly. Just didn’t know how
       to say it. I vote for the weiner dog, Audi and Black and White Jeep
       ad – best copy in my mind.

       And it’s okay that Michelob Ultra officially became the Lululemon
       of beers with its wheezy new tagline “breathe.”

            Will – At least they did something conceptual as opposed to
            millennials on a hike :-)
