   [35]grin and win

    If you have a kid with an adorable smile as I am sure a lot of you do
   – then head on over to the [36]Great Expressions Dental Centers
   Facebook page and enter to win a movie bundle or even a new bicycle!
   That’s right – to encourage children to participate in good oral
   hygiene practices, [37]GEDC has launched a Facebook contest, “Show Us
   Your Smile”, for the month of February which offers parents a chance to
   submit a photo of their child’s smile for a chance to win a free bike
   and movie bundle! Winners will be selected once per week throughout the
   month of February. Visit [38]www.facebook.com/greatexpressions to
   enter.

   My girls love to brush their teeth – they probably would stand at the
   sink and do it all day if I let them. They have Star Wars lightsaber
   toothbrushes that are the most amazing things ever – seriously, I want
   one for myself! I am sure that has a little bit to do with it. We do
   make sure that they floss every day as well. Super important! Check out
   these great Kid’s Dental Tips from Great Expressions Dental Centers
   below – and be sure to enter the contest, you never know!
   [39]I submitted this photo of my daughters!
