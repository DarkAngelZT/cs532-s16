     * [28]There's a secret chess game hidden in Facebook — here's how to
       play (FB)
       Getty ImagesFacebook's messaging app let's you do more than just
       chat with your friends. You can trade GIFs, stickers, and photos.
       But most people don't know that you can also play chess.

       iPhone to cheat during international tournament
       Gaioz Nigalidze’s rise through the ranks of professional chess
       began in 2007, the year the first iPhone was released. In
       hindsight, the timing might not be coincidental. On Saturday,
       Nigalidze, the 25-year-old reigning Georgian champion, was
       competing in the 17th annual Dubai Open Chess Tournament when his
       opponent spotted something strange.

     * [31]Why Facebook Suddenly Wants to Handle Your Money
       Facebook already handles your social life; now it wants to handle
       your money. Hacked screenshots released this month show a hidden
       payment option inside Facebook’s popular Messenger app, which is
       used by 200 million people around the globe. The feature—discovered
       by a Stanford computer science student snooping around existing
       code—would potentially let users send money to one another in a
       message using debit card information.

     * [33]Facebook Inc Replaces Other Inbox With Message Requests
       Facebook is now rolling out Message Requests for Facebook Messenger
       – something which effectively replaces the Other inbox on the
       social networking website. Dave Marcus, Facebook’s VP of messaging
       products, announced the new feature in a Facebook post.
     * [34]‘I didn’t think he was a genius’; Chess player kicked out of
       tournament for using morse code and video to win
       An Italian chess player has been expelled from one his country’s
       most important tournaments after he allegedly used Morse code and a
       pendant containing a hidden camera to communicate with an
       accomplice. Arcangelo Ricciardi entered the International Chess
       Festival of Imperia ranked 51,366 in the world, but astonished
       rivals as he breezed through the early stages of the competition to
       reach the eighth and penultimate round. Jean Coqueraut, who
       refereed the tournament in Liguria, northern Italy, said he began
       to suspect something was wrong early on in the competition.
     * [35]Whatsapp Bothered By Messenger Rival Telegram
       According to numerous posts on the internet, Telegram users on
       Whatsapp claim that the chat application is blocking the links to
       Telegram.me. A secure messaging platform, Telegram recently gained
       popularity amongst users, especially when Whatsapp had some
       outages. On a chat, the URL for Telegram.me was visible, but users
       were unable to access the hyperlinks, nor copy or paste the link
       onto their web browser. Users on some devices did not experience
       this problem, possibly due to the devices not having updated their
       application.
     * [36]Facebook's master plan to earn more money from businesses just
       took its next step
       Facebook is overhauling its Pages feature to make it more useful
       for businesses, the company announced Tuesday afternoon.  It's
       adding new call-to-action buttons that will let businesses
       encourage potential customers to do things like book appointments
       or browse their ecommerce offerings.
     * [37]Magnus Carlsen Is In Great Shape After Game 1 Of The World
       Chess Championship
       Game 1 of the 2014 World Chess Championship was played on Saturday
       and ended in a draw (you can watch it here). I know that sounds
       boring, but it was a fascinating draw and should set the tone for
       the rest of the match.
