This Amnesia: The Dark Descent & Frozen Mash-Up is Something Else

   By [19]John Jacques | 1 week ago

A YouTube series finale contains a bizarre and unexpected mashup between
Amnesia: The Dark Descent and Disney’s Frozen, with the song ‘Let It Go’.
We’re scared.

   Amnesia: The Dark Descent is undoubtedly one of [20]the most horrifying
   games that has ever been released. From its utterly terrifying monster
   to the creaks and groans that stem from a hallucinating mind, it’s
   clear that [21]Amnesia is one of the staple franchises when it comes to
   the horror genre.

   Recently, Frictional Games developer Thomas Grip – who is responsible
   for the aforementioned series – found something even scarier: a live
   action mashup of Amnesia and Disney’s Frozen.

   The below video combines elements from the end game of Amnesia: The
   Dark Descent with adapted lyrics of the Disney hit song ‘Let It Go’
   from Frozen, and the results… well, they really speak for themselves.

   We’ll let interested fans witness the real horror below:

   Thomas Grip stated that he thought he had seen it all before he
   stumbled onto the above video, and in that we have to agree. Grip’s
   latest work with [23]SOMA had asked the question what it means to be
   human, but the above video has us asking an even bigger question: Why?
   Why do things like this even exist?

   As it turns out, Parle Productions has been actively producing and
   releasing a Disney-oriented Amnesia: The Dark Decent video series since
   2014, and the above video happens to be the fifth and final video of
   the entire series. The view count for the video series as a whole
   clocks in at just under 75,000 at the time of this post, and we can’t
   help but feel like the creators deserved more attention for even
   thinking about such a strange mashup.

   Those who may not have played Amnesia are missing out on [24]one of the
   best horror experiences of this generation, and we highly recommend
   they step into the shoes of Daniel. The orb from the video carries much
   significance to the plot of the game, but thankfully, the musical was
   very light in terms of overall spoilers. Those expecting any singing
   segments should probably avoid the game entirely.

   There’s no doubt that the voices behind Daniel and Alexander in the
   parody video have some real talent, even if the video itself ends up
   being a very loose interpretation of the actual events from the
   game. In any event, we’re glad the video suddenly didn’t jump to the
   [25]horrible Amnesia monster shambling towards the camera, so they get
   bonus points for that.

   Amnesia: The Dark Descent is available now on PC, Mac, and Linux.
