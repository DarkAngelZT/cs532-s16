   SANTA CLARA, California (CNN) -

   If this was the final game of Peyton Manning's 18-year career, he
   couldn't have scripted the ending much better.

   A 2-yard rushing touchdown from running back C.J. Anderson -- in
   addition to a defensive score and three field goals from kicker Brandon
   McManus -- gave the Denver Broncos a 24-10 win over the Carolina
   Panthers in Super Bowl 50 in front of 71,088 at Levi's Stadium in Santa
   Clara, California. Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, who had two
   strip-sack fumbles of Panthers quarterback Cam Newton, was named Super
   Bowl Most Valuable Player.

   Manning, at 39, is the oldest starting quarterback in Super Bowl
   history. Going into Sunday, he hadn't confirmed if Super Bowl 50 would
   be his last game. But it sure felt that way. And like his boss, Broncos
   general manager and executive vice president of football operations
   John Elway, Manning can ride off into the sunset after securing his
   second championship in his career.

   After the win, Manning was noncommittal on his future.

   "You know, I'll take some time to reflect," Manning said. "I have a
   couple of priorities first. I want to go kiss my wife and my kids, I
   want to go hug my family. I'm going to drink a lot of Budweiser
   tonight. I promise you that. I'm going to take care of those things
   first, and say a little prayer to thank the man upstairs for this great
   opportunity. I'm just very grateful."

   Manning is also the first quarterback to win a Super Bowl with two
   different teams. He also won Super Bowl XLI when he was with the
   Indianapolis Colts.

   With the win, Manning became the first NFL quarterback with 200 career
   wins (186 regular season and 14 postseason). He had been tied with
   Brett Favre, a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2016,
   with 199.

   "Being on two different teams, winning a Super Bowl with each team, I'm
   proud of that," Manning said.

   Manning -- good enough for the win

   Manning didn't play flawlessly, but he did enough, which is all a
   suffocating Broncos-led defense has needed this season. Manning's line:
   13 of 23 passing for 141 yards with one interception and a lost fumble.

   Manning's 18th -- and perhaps final -- season has been his most
   challenging.

   He was benched for the first time in his career, which was a loss to
   the Kansas City Chiefs in November. While backup Brock Osweiler filled
   in, Manning missed six games because of a partially torn plantar fascia
   in his left foot.

   But in Week 17, Manning returned, coming off the bench to lead Denver
   to a win over the San Diego Chargers to clinch a first-round bye in the
   playoffs.

   Manning called it "a unique season."

   "I certainly knew with this defense that this team would have a
   chance," Manning said. "Our defense has just been from the get-go,
   they've been nothing but awesome. Being hurt, the struggle early in the
   season wasn't a lot of fun, so I was grateful to get back healthy and
   to try to play my part these last couple of weeks."

   It started well for the Broncos (15-4) on their opening drive, capped
   by a 34-yard McManus field goal to take an early 3-0.

   It was a different story for Carolina (17-2).

   The Panthers, having lost just once coming into this game, were
   accustomed to having their way offensively.

   Carolina had the league's top offense this year -- averaging 31.3
   points per game in the regular season and a whopping 40 points per game
   in the postseason. Newton was responsible for 79.3% of the Panthers'
   offensive scores this season heading into Sunday.

   But Carolina didn't face a defense like Denver's all season. The
   Broncos lead the NFL in total defense, pass defense and sacks. Newton
   got to see -- and feel -- that up close. He was sacked seven times,
   tying a Super Bowl record.

   The one that was the most costly came in the first quarter, Carolina's
   second turn on offense. On Carolina's 15-yard line, Miller forced a
   Newton fumble on the strip sack for an 11-yard loss while defensive end
   Malik Jackson scooped up the ball for the score to give Denver a 10-0
   lead. It was the first fumble recovery for a touchdown in a Super Bowl
   in 22 years.

   Later in the second quarter, Carolina coughed up the football again.
   This time, Broncos safety Darian Stewart forced a fumble from Panthers
   fullback Mike Tolbert; inside linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered.

   Courtesy of a huge mistake by Broncos' cornerback Aqib Talib, the
   Panthers were able to capitalize and get on the scoreboard with a
   1-yard run by running back Jonathan Stewart. What transpired the play
   before was a face mask personal foul penalty by Talib.

   Talib had a terrible first half with three penalties, two of which were
   personal fouls.

   But Carolina squandered an opportunity early in the third quarter when
   a 44-yard field goal attempt by Graham Gano hit the right upright.
   Later in the quarter, Newton threw an interception into the hands of
   safety T.J. Ward, quashing a promising drive that had Carolina in
   Denver territory.
