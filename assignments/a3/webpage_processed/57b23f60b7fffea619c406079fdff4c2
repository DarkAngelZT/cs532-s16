Cam Newton walks out of Super Bowl press conference after giving
one-word answers

   team's Super Bowl loss.

   [52]Carolina Panthers quarterback [53]Cam Newton was obviously
   devastated and in a foul mood following his team's loss to the
   [54]Denver Broncos in [55]the Super Bowl. But players are required to
   answer questions of the media, and Newton technically met that
   requirement on Sunday evening.

   He ignored multiple questions, and when he did answer, for the most
   part, he gave one-word responses and clearly had plenty of emotions
   boiling under the surface. It's unclear how much time Newton is
   supposed to spend with the media, but he definitely remarked that he
   was going to leave, got up and walked away while focus seemed to be on
   one reporter asking a specific question.

   This is how the entire press conference looks on paper:

   Cam presser Cam presser

   Newton did not have a good game for the Panthers. He led his team to
   the most productive offense in the NFL this season, but finished
   Sunday's game having completed 18 of 41 passes for 265 yards with no
   touchdowns and an interception. He didn't get much help from his
   offensive line, as he was sacked six times for a loss of 64 yards.
