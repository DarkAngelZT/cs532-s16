[36]ASUS Announces Travelair AC Wireless Flash Drive

   By [37]Jamie Fuller | [38]News | [39]No Comments

   When you think about Asus, can you really picture them making a
   wireless flash drive? Who am I kidding, Asus are one of the most
   craziest companies in the industry when it comes to creating products
   that are over the top. I mean we all remember the ASUS RT-AC5300
   Wireless Router right? Today however they announced a product that is a
   little different, providing portable storage with built in WiFi. The
   best thing about this product however, is the built-in 3000mAh battery
   which allows you to use this without any annoying wires.
