Governor Pat McCrory involved in crash in CA following Super Bowl

   SAN JOSE, CA (WBTV) -

   North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory was involved in a car crash in
   California Sunday night, after attending the Super Bowl.

   CBS affiliate KPIX is reporting the crash happened in San Jose along
   Highway 237. California Highway Patrol told KPIX that McCrory's vehicle
   was rear-ended by a Mercedes.

   According to McCrory's office, that vehicle was a California Highway
   Patrol vehicle McCrory was a passenger in. The vehicle was reportedly
   totaled.

   While Governor McCrory only suffered minor pain from the accident, he
   was able to continue to his destination in another vehicle.

   “We were very fortunate, and while I am still proud of the Carolina
   Panthers, this puts the game in proper perspective,” said Governor
   McCrory. “I want to thank the California Highway Patrol and EMS for
   their professionalism and quick action.”

   KPIX says one person who was in the vehicle had to be taken to the
   hospital to be checked out.
