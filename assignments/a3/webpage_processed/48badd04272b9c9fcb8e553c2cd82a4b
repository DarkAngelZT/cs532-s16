   with Nebula: Sole Survivor. It’s the story of engineers and astronauts
   on a deadly moon of Jupiter called Europa. Discover new creatures and
   weapons as you fight off levels of the “Infection,” to get off of the
   moon that was once going to become a second Earth for human life. Learn
   the layout and solve puzzles as you fight your way to an escape through
   the underground base, CICADA, fighting off anything that comes your
   way. Become the survivor and experience the fear of Europa’s creatures
   down every turn. Join the fight!

Meet Ivy Howlett

   Ivy Howlett was born in South Africa, and at 16 years old enlisted
   herself into the United Interstellar Administration. Ivy left
   everything behind her as she was quickly relocated to an isolated
   Maritime Base. After training in science and engineering, her drive and
   dedication in the UIA drove her to become one of the best Aerospace
   Engineers in her class. She watched others fail and leave the base
   while she stayed and trained hard every day because of her fear of
   getting sent back.

   The days came and went, and one morning Ivy received a bright orange
   holocanvas message sent directly to her from the Director himself. As
   her lips moved through every sentence, her face began to light up. Ivy
   had been selected to become a member of the Astronaut Program as a
   mission specialist for a task on the Jupiter Project. This is what she
   dreamed of since she was a child.

   The years have passed. She is no longer just Ivy Howlett, but Doctor
   Ivy Howlett, Mission Specialist for the United Interstellar
   Administration in her late twenties, becoming one of the youngest
   recruits ever in her occupation. Her training was complete and Project
   Jupiter had just begun for her. Her mission, as part of the third human
   team, is to colonize Europa, the icy moon that orbits Jupiter and is
   considered to be the perfect place to begin colonization for a new
   Earth. All of this was being led by her mentor, Dr. James Rickman, the
   founder of the mission and CICADA Base. The Third Human Team was to
   handle all heavy and precious equipment that robots simply could not
   handle alone, while studying the planet everyday they were there.

   They thought they were alone on Europa, they thought Jupiter was
   messing up their signals and causing the strange lifeform readings.
   Then the people of the third team began to disappear.

   Personal File Recording From Ivy

“The crew… the base… and our entire research is lost.”

   It was on the 67th day of the mission that The Infection began to take
   over. These creatures, these monsters, killed the team with brute force
   and had no mercy as they began to attack the humans one after another.
   Ivy was one of the few to survive, with others following her to safety.
   She and the other survivors sprinted to an escape ship, thinking they
   were finally safe, but then she saw it.

   The Infection was in the ship already, and Ivy could only watch as her
   fellow teammates and friends were slaughtered and destroyed in front of
   her. The escape shuttle was damaged. Red flashing lights and sirens
   went off, and Ivy fought desperately for her life, all the while
   watching the chaos through her suit's helmet. The ship began to fall
   quickly back into Europa. Ivy jumped out of the ship before it crashed,
   and blacked out on the ground from impact.

   She woke up to a ring in her ears and felt constant pain everywhere as
   she came to realize she was back on Europa’s white frozen ground. She
   checked her suit, fully intact, but noticed that she only had enough
   oxygen for a short time. The bright, frozen land in front of her
   blinded her vision as she stumbled to get up. She started to run as
   fast as she could to the nearest CICADA Base entrance. She would be
   safe there. She knew she could survive and pushed to the entrance as
   her tank of oxygen depleted to the bottom. On her visor, an alarm
   message. The tank needed to be replaced immediately. Her thoughts
   started to become a blur. “The door is so close,” she kept repeating,
   “don’t quit, there is no choice but to fight.”

   The game takes place on an icy moon of Jupiter, Europa. In a not so
   distant future, the United Interstellar Administration has settled a
   top-notch scientific research station on Europa, called CICADA Biomass
   and Geology Ground Base.

   The CICADA Base spreads across many miles under the icy surface. It's
   the largest human complex ever built outside Earth, and its purpose was
   both to study the life forms that were detected deep inside the
   subterranean caves of Europa, and to start laying the foundations for
   the first human colony within the Jupiter Sector.

The Jupiter IV-ALPHA Project

   The Jupiter IV-ALPHA Project is a network of satellites orbiting the
   Europa moon, with the sole purpose of collecting geological and orbital
   data.

   Originally started by Dr. James Rickman, the mentor of Ivy Howllet, the
   Project's development led to the construction of the underground CICADA
   Base on the Europa moon to support human missions. The astronauts' job
   was to study and collect organic samples and lifeforms on the cold
   deserted moon. At first, it was only small insect like creatures that
   showed up underground, thought to be harmless. Dr. Rickman recruited
   the third human team to study the creatures’ natural habitat, an icy
   cave complex called the Theseus Lair. They set their research in motion
   to learn more about the creatures which they now called the Europa
   Cicada of Project Jupiter.

Rewards

Highlights

     * Open world sci-fi map to explore, inside the base and out on the
       surface
     * Player-driven, non-linear gameplay. Explore and upgrade your own
       way. You are free to come and go around the CICADA Base as you wish
     * Crafting. Need a hand with those creatures? How about building your
       own automated turret, traps, and proximity mines?
     * Upgrades are key. Upgrades and items unlock other parts of the
       habitat
     * Realistic Artificial Intelligence. The creatures feel real and will
       hunt you down. They can hear you moving, and cooperate with each
       other to attack
     * Jaw-dropping visuals. You've never seen this level of detail in
       this genre

Who

   My name is Bruno de Araujo, creator of Nebula: Sole Survivor. I'm an
   experienced CG Artist working with 3D environments and renderings
   living in Vancouver, Canada.
   I've been working on this project for a couple of years now. It all
   started when I was still in college and thought to myself “Hey, what if
   I made a game?” Of course that was unrealistic at the time, but the
   idea and the passion for it stuck with me. It was in 2015, when I moved
   from Brazil to Canada with my beautiful wife that I realized that this
   could be a reality. I am very passionate about this project, and I'm
   always looking for ways to make the game better, adding features,
   enemies, scenery details, and at this point I can finally say that it's
   on the path where I’ve always wanted it to be.

Talita Rodacki

   Tali is my wife, and she happens to be a great voice actress and
   writer. She is Ivy's voice and emotion.

Oscar Fogelström

   Oscar is an award winning composer for film and TV. His recent work can
   be seen in the film "The Hypnotist", by director Lasse Hallström.

Open Beta

   I'm very excited to show you what we have so far! And I’m not just
   saying it: go ahead and download the FREE Open Beta.

    DISCLAIMER
     * The BETA is just a small part of what's ready. I'm saving the rest
       for the final release, of course.
     * The BETA has a beginning and an end, but they are both
       "placeholders", just so it doesn't end too abruptly.
     * Some features that are still under development and not polished
       enough for a public release were disabled for this first beta, but
       you can still have a pretty comprehensive experience. Have fun!

Why Kickstarter?

   The funds that I'm asking for will be directed towards bringing this
   game to the next level, to make it go from "good" to "awesome". For
   that, I would like to hire artists, sound designers, and developers to
   help me finish this project and bring a great game to the world. I want
   to create something that generations will play for years to come, so
   people can see the story unfold and watch our protagonist Ivy grow as
   she fights through all of these battles to be a survivor. I need your
   help to make this a reality, please donate to this campaign in any way
   possible. Any donation small or large will help.

Risks and challenges

   Obstacles are presented by every project, and unexpected things may
   happen. I believe that with the right amount of effort and inspiration,
   we can do great things.

   I've come this far and the Beta is here to prove that. The core of
   Nebula: Sole Survivor is ready. Now, with your help, it's time to turn
   this into a real, finished game. It's time for polishing the gameplay,
   adding new animations, new enemies, new features, and, of course, it's
   time to create additional and enhanced content.

FAQ

     * [79]What's included in the BETA?
       The Beta is a test version for the final game. It contains just the
       most basic mechanics and aspects that will be included in the final
       release, and it's not yet optimized. Be warned that you should also
       expect glitches and bugs that might affect your gaming experience.
       Getting a little technical, other developers would call this an
       "alpha", but I don't agree with that nomenclature for public
       releases.
       Last updated: Tue, Feb 2 2016 12:53 am EST
     * [80]Will there be a coop mode?
       I'm trying my best to make the coop mode available. This will be a
       standalone game mode, and will tell the story of what happened
       before the crew tried to escape from Europa, when the creatures
       first attacked. It'll be a defense/survival game mode.
       Last updated: Tue, Feb 2 2016 1:03 am EST
     * [81]Will Nebula: Sole Survivor be available for Mac and Linux? How
       about consoles?
       It's very possible that the game will be available for other
       platforms than PC. All I need to know is what platforms would the
       players like to see the most.
       Last updated: Tue, Feb 2 2016 1:03 am EST
     * [82]How about the final game duration? How long will it be?
       The beta already offers between 30 to 45 minutes of gameplay. The
       final version will be a lot longer!
       Last updated: Wed, Feb 3 2016 7:19 pm EST
     * [83]DLC?
       No. All future content updates will be free of charge. If a future
       update has features enough and adds a lot of new content (like,
       let's say, an entire new planet), there's a chance it'll be
       considered an Expansion Pack. No small "paid DLC" will ever exist
       for this game.
