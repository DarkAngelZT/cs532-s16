   The deceased have been identified as Bosco Asiimwe and Zowedi Mukasa

   Police in Kampala is hunting for Brian Ssempala a police constable, who
   on Saturday night shot two people dead, after they were found playing
   cards in Makindye Kampala.

   The deceased whose bodies are being kept at Mulago Hospital mortuary in
   Kampala, have been identified as Bosco Asiimwe and Zowedi Mukasa, all
   residents of Makindye.

   “The unfortunate incident happened around midnight on Saturday, when
   one of our officer s shot two people dead, one died instantly and the
   other died on arrival at Nsambya Hospital,” Kampala Metropolitan Police
   spokesperson Patrick Onyango told New Vision on Sunday.

   According to Onyango, Ssempala who was on night duty guarding KCCA
   offices in Makindye was moving around Makindye at midnight, when he
   found a group of youth playing matatu (cards).

   Onyango further explained that when the officer tried to interrogate
   the youth why they were playing cards late in the night, a fight ensued
   between the officer and the youth, which resulted into shooting by the
   officer, killing the two.

   “The officer is currently on the run, and we are looking for him, you
   can run but you cannot hide, this is a murder case and he will be
   charged with murder,” said Onyango.

   In July last year, another police officer shot a Forum for Democratic
   Change (FDC) supporter in Najjanankumbi a Kampala suburb during
   nominations for FDC’S presidential candidate Dr. Kizza Besigye.

   The officer was trying to disperse chanting FDC supporters from
   blocking the Entebbe –Kampala Road during the nomination exercise.

   The same year in October, three people were reportedly gunned down by a
   police officer at Akokoro sub-county in Apac District in an operation
   against illegal fishing activities on Lake Kyoga.
