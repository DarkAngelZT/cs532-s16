	<title><![CDATA[Jimmie Johnson's Anything With An Engine™]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[Jimmie Johnson's Anything With An Engine is an extreme Mario Kart type racing game as imagined by NASCAR legend Jimmie Johnson. In the game world, to fulfill the competition's 'Anything with an Engine!' motto, the contestants race the most insane vehicle designs created by Jimmie’s world class crew from some of the most unlikely of everyday objects – such as tubs, coffins, lawnmowers. Each vehicle is equipped with nitro, and custom front missiles, rear mines, and hydraulic rams - the event’s signature combat mechanism. All of these devices are activated and upgraded throughout each race by showing off driving skills and winning the favor of the crowds who cheer on and cast their votes to provide power-ups to the racers. Enter Jimmie's El Cajon Arena and engage in various race and elimination-style events across progressively more challenging tracks, decked out with pyrotechnics-laden theatrical sets and strewn with wicked hazards, traps, and jumps!]]></description>

	<title><![CDATA[TRINITY: Souls of Zill O'll™]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[A king will die at the hands of his own offspring, reads the prophecy of Chancellor Zofor. King Balor fears this most of all... According to myth, the continent of Vyashion as well as the physical world was created by a god called Notoon. Although the continent’s peoples universally worship Notoon, their shared faith has failed to bring unity. Vyashion’s many races, from human to elf and vampire have maintained an uneasy peace amongst each other. The source of the tension stems from the King Balor and the Dyneskal Empire. Key Features: Brought together by fate, the three adventurers in your party must work together to explore Vyashion’s fields, dungeons and towns, collect items, survive encounters with mythological beasts and ultimately defeat the evil King Balor. An innovative team system lets you alternate between each of the three characters: a warrior, a wizard/swordsman and an assassin. Magic abilities and physical offensives can be used together to unleash combo attacks. A completely interactive environment. Uncover new paths by destroying objects, set areas aflame or freeze them with spell casting. Throughout the game, side quests add more adventures and depth to an already rich experience.]]></description>

	<title><![CDATA[WARRIORS: Legends of Troy™]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[3000 years ago, a poet sang of heroes strong enough to stand alone against an army. For love, they sailed the world. For family, they made the greatest sacrifices. For honor, they stood and faced the will of gods, And fought a war which shook the earth. In the age when Zeus Almighty ruled over immortals and men, what begins as a truce between two cities quickly erupts into a massive war that will shake the very foundations of Olympus. Two great armies clash not over home and country, but for the love of a single woman. The fates of these civilizations now stand upon the razor's edge. FEATURES Do battle as the Trojans or the Greeks. With two unique storylines, players will see the war from two perspectives. Clash with legions of soldiers on glorious battlegrounds that reach for miles Do whatever you must to survive in battle. Grab a sword from a fallen enemy and hurl it at a soldier bearing down on you. Smash an opponent with your shield, and then run your spear through him. Or, if you're strong enough, just throttle them with your bare hands. Battle larger-than-life heroes and even confront mythical creatures sent by the gods themselves. Among the inspirations for the game are The Iliad, Homer’s epic poem from the 9th century BC, and in-depth research of the ancient battlefields of the Trojan War.]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[Rise up against slavery with the latest single-player action-adventure game in the Assassin’s Creed® franchise. Assassin’s Creed® Freedom Cry is available exclusively for download on PC, PlayStation®4 and PlayStation®3 computer entertainment systems. Born a slave, Adewale was sold to a plantation owner at a young age. When pirates raided the plantation, Adewale escaped and found freedom as a pirate. Now Adewale has become a trained Assassin and an illustrious member of the Brotherhood. Port-au-Prince in 1735 is home to the most brutal slavery in the West Indies. Two thousand oppressed men, women, and children produce sugar, coffee, cotton, and indigo under the watch of six hundred French citizens, who live in constant apprehension of a violent rebellion. After being shipwrecked in what is now known as Haiti and left without weapons or a crew, Adewale starts to assist the locals in an effort to assemble a crew and steal a ship. The more he helps, however, the more he is drawn into the Maroon slave community. Forced to face his past, he sets out to free the slaves and bring death to their captors. Originally released as an add-on for Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™, Adewale’s epic adventure is now available as its own stand-alone title; purchase of Assassin’s Creed IV Black Flag is not required. AN IMPOSING ASSASSIN – Born a slave, now a seasoned Assassin trained by pirates, Adewale will face his past once and for all. As strong as ever, Adewale’s power resides in his imposing stature and his self-control. Along with his hidden blades, Adewale is a master of a new set of powerful weapons, including a booming blunderbuss and a deadly machete. FIGHT SLAVERY IN 18TH-CENTURY HAITI – Discover the secrets and horrors of Saint-Domingue and Port-au-Prince by land and by sea. Help rebuild the Maroon resistance in order to plant the seeds of emancipation among the slaves as you witness the brutal reality of slavery in the 18th century. - Assassinate enemies and free the slaves in exotic Port-au-Prince. - Deliver merciless justice in plantations. - Experience the visceral brutality of two new weapons: the machete and the blunderbuss. ALL FEAR CAPTAIN ADEWALE – Command the Experto Crede, a fearsome brig that will strike terror in the hearts of all slave ship crews. Chase and plunder enemy vessels to upgrade the Experto Crede and take down the slavers in the Caribbean.]]></description>

	<title><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed® Liberation HD]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[The year is 1765. While the seeds of the American Revolution are being sewn in Boston and New York, Spanish forces in the South plot to seize control of Louisiana for the Templars, threatening to forever shift the balance of power in the New World. As Templars secretly take hold of the slave trade in New Orleans, Aveline de Grandpré, an assassin of mixed French and African heritage, stands ready to defend her people. She soon finds herself on an unforgettable journey that will take her from the crowded streets of New Orleans to voodoo-haunted swamps and ancient Mayan ruins. Whether eliminating her enemies with new assassination skills or luring them into cunning traps, Aveline strikes mortal fear into the hearts of those who would stand against freedom. Arriving for the first time as a digital title on PlayStation 3 Assassin’s Creed® Liberation HD is the striking chapter of the pre-American Revolution Assassin’s Creed saga, featuring unique assassin gameplay mechanics, an immersive Assassin's Creed storyline delivered in stunning high-definition. THE DEFINITIVE LIBERATION EXPERIENCE Taking full advantage of its new hardware, Liberation HD introduces a complete graphical overhaul, re-mastered music and sound effects, a revamped gameplay experience, and new missions that dive deeper into Aveline’s story. A CUNNING NEW ASSASSIN As Aveline, the first playable female Assassin in the Assassin’s Creed saga, you must use your skill, instinct and weaponry – including a machete, poison-dart blowpipe, a whip and duelling pistols – to hunt down and eliminate your enemies. Change from disguise to disguise, assaulting your opponents directly as an Assassin, charming foes into vicious traps as a lady, or impersonating a slave to incite a riot to elude your pursuers. DISCOVER THE FULL ASSASSIN’S CREED STORY With a unique storyline that sheds light on the nefarious dealings of Abstergo Industries, Liberation HD also introduces Aveline, a new character in the Assassin’s Creed universe at the very heart of the escalating Assassin and Templar conflict in the New World. SURVIVE THE NEW WORLD Feast your eyes on a richly-detailed world, thanks to the AnvilNext engine which features groundbreaking physics, animation and innovative combat system. Outmaneuver your enemies in the Louisiana bayou with the unique Tree Navigation system, and eliminate them from above with deadly precision. Deep dive underwater as you search for lost Mayan treasures, but stay alert, for Aveline is not the only predator who stalks the hostile wilderness.]]></description>

	<title><![CDATA[Dynasty Warriors 8]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[The definitive Dynasty Warriors experience! DYNASTY WARRIORS 8 returns to the kingdoms of Wei, Wu, Shu, and Jin, through the actions of historical military and political figures of the time, as they fight to gain control over the Three Kingdoms of China. DYNASTY WARRIORS 8 takes the much loved series one step further, merging numerous replay elements such as multi-endings and extra modes with synergies between action and game systems for a deeper, more dramatic story than ever. With all new enhancements to Story Mode, new scenarios, an all-new Ambition Mode, new and returning characters, actions and more, DYNASTY WARRIORS 8 promises to offer fans the most complete Warriors experience to date. Take to the battlefield with the greatest warriors in history and carve your path to glory! FEATURES Story Mode: Featuring new episodes and characters, Story Mode takes a deeper look at the drama as it unfolds in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. New ‘What If?’ Scenarios: Breaking away from historical fact, this mode takes a look at what could have happened if famous characters had lived to fight another day. Fulfilling certain conditions in battle will affect how scenarios develop, giving players an alternate take on the Three Kingdoms history. New Ambition Mode: Take on the role of a commander and build up your own camp by recruiting allies and collecting materials to construct the great Tonquetai Palace for the Emperor in this new mode. Free Mode: Play through unlocked scenarios as the officer of your choice, regardless of allegiance. Experience certain scenarios from the point of view of a rival kingdom. Three Point System: Weapons are given one of three element attributes: Heaven, Earth, or Man. Each element is strong (advantage) or weak (disadvantage) to each other in this Three Point System, greatly affecting how damaging your attacks are against enemies. Check the opposing officer’s element and switch weapons to gain the upper hand in battle. New Action Elements: Use the Storm Rush attack to perform a barrage of attacks, or trigger a Switch Counter for a timely counter attack. When certain conditions are met during battle, players enter a state of Rage to perform powerful Rage Attacks, and ultimately unleash a vicious True Rage Attack. New and Returning Characters: Over 70 playable characters, with returning fan-favorites and 10 new members to the series—including the highly anticipated officers Yue Jin and Li Dian from the Wei Kingdom. Co-op play: Offline and online co-op play for two players! A New Landscape: Taking further inspiration from the landscape of ancient China, a stronger emphasis is given to the setting of these epic battles. 44 new stages have been created, including verdant plains, sharp ravines, desolate wastelands, and towering castles!]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[From critically acclaimed director Hideo Kojima, METAL GEAR SOLID: The Legacy Collection offers the most complete METAL GEAR SOLID experience ever. Featuring eight complete games, METAL GEAR, METAL GEAR 2, METAL GEAR SOLID 1, METAL GEAR SOLID 2: HD Edition, METAL GEAR SOLID 3: HD Edition METAL GEAR SOLID 4: Trophy Edition, METAL GEAR SOLID: Peace Walker HD Edition, and METAL GEAR SOLID: VR MISSIONS along with two Ashley Wood Digital Graphic, the Legacy Collection offers Metal Gear and stealth action fans a chance to experience all the heroic game play, compelling design and immersive storytelling of the MGS franchise in one complete package. The "Metal Gear" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 33 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected. The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society. These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business.]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[Key Features: Challenging levels: Discover three distinctive worlds with a total of 23 levels, which can be transformed from a colorful dream to an eerie nightmare at the push of a button. Personal style: Regardless whether you dash through the levels in speed-run or take your time to explore every last corner, Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams offers something for everyone. Superb graphics: Dreamlike landscapes transform themselves from lush, resplendent surroundings into surreal, withered nightmare worlds, in which there are always new details to discover. Intriguing puzzles: Blocked paths open up when Giana transforms herself; lovely flowerbeds mutate into deadly thorn bushes, and some diamonds can only be gathered in one form or the other. Diverse playing modes: The game is challenging in normal mode, but it can be a truly harrowing experience in hardcore and super-hardcore modes. Legendary soundtrack: Listen to Chris Hülsbeck’s music as it transitions from the classic chiptunes to the metal riffs of the Swedish SID-rockers, Machinae Supremacy. Epic boss-battles: Whether devilish demons or powerful end-bosses, you will need every trick in your arsenal to defeat your opponents.]]></description>

	<title><![CDATA[Dead Island™ Riptide]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[Over four million players around the world survived the ordeals of the zombie infestation on the once beautiful island resort of Banoi, and our group of survivors thought they had finally found a safe place to escape from this terrifying nightmare. They were wrong. Shortly after the battle-hardened team had landed their helicopter on a military ship, a furious storm hits and havoc quickly spreads on board. Suddenly, they find themselves struggling for their lives again in new, terrifying scenarios with all hope drowning in the rising waves… Dead Island Riptide draws you back into a tropical nightmare with invigorating new elements infused into its proven recipe for fun: Innovative Gameplay: Drawing from popular styles of strategic combat gives fans the ultimate zombie-fighting experience. New hub defense missions mean the co-op teamwork skills of the survivors will be tested to the limit. Strategically place traps, fences and turrets to fend off oncoming Zombie onslaughts, protect the survivors in these sanctuaries and above all, make it out alive. Raised Level Cap & Save Game Imports: Players can either start a character from scratch, or import their save games from the original Dead Island and continue developing their character with all new skills to choose from and a raised level cap. New Playable Character Class: A fifth character choice, John Morgan, will join the team with a unique martial arts skillset, inspired by popular Dead Island fan-produced game mods. New Locations & Drivable Vehicles: A monsoon has hit the once beautiful archipelago and heavy rainstorms have laid waste to large areas of the islands. The city of Henderson and jungle areas on the island of Palanai succumbed to devastating rain, leaving boats as the only remaining way of transportation to certain places. It’s sink or swim. Chilling Zombie Mutations: The combined skills of the group will be sorely needed, since terrible, new and unknown zombie mutations have emerged all over the island.

	<title><![CDATA[Thomas Was Alone]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[Thomas Was Alone is the critically acclaimed indie platformer about friendship and jumping. Guide a group of sentient rectangles through a series of environments, combining their skills to reach the end of each level. Listen to awesome music by David Housden, negotiate obstacles meticulously placed by Mike Bithell and immerse yourself in the characters’ journey with a voiceover read wistfully and amusingly by Danny Wallace. Discover the story of the world's first sentient AIs, and how they worked together to, well… “escape” is a strong word. “Emerge” might be better. “Emerge” has an air of importance about it, while keeping a plethora of plot twists and origin stories under wraps. We didn't even mention the bouncing. That'd be overkill. Features: 100 levels. 12 playable characters, each with unique characteristics and abilities. Story narrated by Danny Wallace. Soundtrack by critically acclaimed composer David Housden. Commentary for every level by creator Mike Bithell.]]></description>

God Mode combines non-linear gameplay, fast and frantic shooting, hordes of on-screen enemies, a fully functional online coop mode, and features visuals and gameplay that rival that of a full-priced boxed title. Matches rarely--if ever--play out the same, as dozens of in-game modifiers can significantly alter the gameplay on the fly. Characters are fully customizable, both in appearance and equipment, which continually evolve. Gold and experience are constantly accrued and used to unlock new and satisfying weaponry and unique powerful abilities, both of which can be further upgraded.]]></description>

	<title><![CDATA[Dragon Fantasy Book I]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[Experience an all-new old adventure! Fight your way through hordes of strange, silly, and scary monsters! Explore the caves, castles, and dungeons of an ancient evil! Meet warriors, princes, pirates, zombies, and crazy old woodsmen in a huge world of epic retro adventure! Dragon Fantasy is a project that Adam Rippon and Bryan Sawler began in 1995 when they were both 14 years old. Today they're both in their 30s and Adam is going bald. Plus, they're both getting just a wee bit pudgy. The game sat on the lonely shelf of lost ideas for most of the 2000s, while Adam and Bryan focused on their careers in the game industry. However, after his father passed away in late 2010, Adam resurrected the project as a tribute. Adam cut 90% of the story of the game so he could focus solely on the story of his father's character, Ogden. Over time, the team has been adding pieces of the original story back into the game, successfully bringing their 18 year old childhood dream to life! With a sequel in development for PlayStation®3 and PS®Vita, the Dragon Fantasy team at Muteki decided to remaster the original game in the style of a 16-bit remake of the 8-bit original. This remake adds optional 16-bit enhanced mode featuring new graphics and sound, a redesigned status system, and an all new dungeon! In addition, the Cross-Save and Cross-Buy features will make the game easier than ever to enjoy on multiple systems!]]></description>

This new co-op play combined with enhanced in-game physics will further enhance the idea that “PlayStyle Matters” – a unique approach to gameplay pioneered by Warren Spector where players dynamically tackle different challenges to in order to explore all possibilities and storylines, but with consequences for their chosen actions. Players will enjoy the most realistic gaming experience, where they can use the Playstation Move controller to bring to life the magic of Mickey's paintbrush and Oswald's remote control. In addition to painting and thinning, the Move controller will allow the player to re-program enemies using Oswald's remote control abilities.]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[It takes blood, sweat, and tears to become the best in the world. And if you want to rise to the top on your terms, you better bring the Attitude, and ignite a revolution. Last summer, one man revolutionized the sports entertainment industry. In a legendary moment at the end of Monday Night Raw, CM Punk shook up WWE and a hero was born. Fifteen years ago, one Stone Cold Rattlesnake revolutionized entertainment and ignited a new generation of WWE fans with his relentless Attitude. Now, a new revolution is upon us, and it doesn’t start with someone on TV, the web, or at a live event. This revolution starts with you. It’s time to Live the Revolution.

An era where The Rock told opponents to “know your role, and shut your mouth”, where the Undertaker threw Mankind off the top of the Hell in a Cell, and D-Generation X broke all the rules. Now, for the first time, relive this groundbreaking era in an all-new single player campaign mode that will make you experience the Monday Night Wars like never before. WWE UNIVERSE 3.0 – The fan-favorite WWE Universe mode returns, giving you more control over WWE than ever before.

	<description><![CDATA[Dishonored is an immersive first-person action game that casts you as a supernatural assassin driven by revenge. With Dishonored’s flexible combat system, creatively eliminate your targets as you combine the supernatural abilities, weapons and unusual gadgets at your disposal. Pursue your enemies under the cover of darkness or ruthlessly attack them head on with weapons drawn. The outcome of each mission plays out based on the choices you make. STORY: Dishonored is set in Dunwall, an industrial whaling city where strange steampunk- inspired technology and otherworldly forces coexist in the shadows. You are the once-trusted bodyguard of the beloved Empress. Framed for her murder, you become an infamous assassin, known only by the disturbing mask that has become your calling card. In a time of uncertainty, when the city is besieged by plague and ruled by a corrupt government armed with industrial technologies, dark forces conspire to bestow upon you abilities beyond those of any common man – but at what cost? The truth behind your betrayal is as murky as the waters surrounding the city, and the life you once had is gone forever. KEY FEATURES: Improvise and Innovate Approach each assassination with your own style of play. Use shadow and sound to your advantage to make your way silently through levels unseen by foes, or attack enemies head-on as they respond to your aggression. The flexible combat system allows you to creatively combine your abilities, supernatural powers and gadgets as you make your way through the levels and dispatch your targets. Improvise and innovate to define your play style. Action with Meaning The world of Dishonored reacts to how you play. Move like a ghost and resist corruption, or show no mercy and leave a path of destruction in your wake. Decide your approach for each mission, and the outcomes will change as a result. Supernatural Abilities Teleport for stealth approaches, possess any living creature, or stop time itself to orchestrate unearthly executions! Combining your suite of supernatural abilities and weapons opens up even more ways to overcome obstacles and eliminate targets. The game’s upgrade system allows for the mastery of deadly new abilities and devious gadgets. A City Unlike Any Other Enter an original world envisioned by Half-Life 2 art director Viktor Antonov. Arkane and Bethesda bring you a steampunk city where industry and the supernatural collide, creating an atmosphere thick with intrigue. The world is yours to discover.]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[A few years after the arrival of the Black Ships in Uraga ended Japan's long history of isolation, the population is divided between accepting the new ways of the West and trying to preserve their own culture. Amihama, a harbor city long known for its fishing industry and abundance of taverns, has become a robust trading town filled with Westerners since the forced opening of the country’s ports. The town is now filled with European-styled buildings, which hint at a new era for Japan, but many locals still harbor a deep resentment toward the sudden influx of foreigners. Meanwhile, foreigners confined to living in a specially designated district claim discrimination, while the official shogunate Japanese forces clash against vigilante isolationists and foreigners alike, each fighting for their beliefs and way of life. Into the mayhem arrives a lone samurai, and the actions he takes and the allegiances he forms will change the course of the nation.]]></description>

CS:GO features new maps, characters, and weapons and delivers updated versions of the classic CS content (de_dust, etc.). In addition, CS:GO will introduce new gameplay modes, matchmaking, leader boards, and more.

"For the past 12 years, it has continued to be one of the most-played games in the world, headline competitive gaming tournaments and selling over 25 million units worldwide across the franchise. CS:GO promises to expand on CS' award-winning gameplay".]]></description>

	<title><![CDATA[Resident Evil®: Operation Raccoon City]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[Resident Evil®: Operation Raccoon City delivers a true third person team based shooter experience set within the dark and sinister Resident Evil® universe. Not only does this setting provide a rich backdrop to the action but it fosters a unique and thrilling triple-threat battle scenario for the game modes. Zombies and Bio-Organic Weapons (B.O.W's) add to the mix as players compete against their team's opposing squad but also tackle this third unpredictable element that could only exist in the twisted Resident Evil universe. The result is a brand new style of gameplay that breaks the conventions of traditional third person shooters. It is September 1998 and the action focuses on the ill-fated Raccoon City and the horrific consequences of the deadly T-virus outbreak. With a cover up required, Umbrella orders an elite team into Raccoon City to destroy all evidence of its involvement. Meanwhile the US Government has quarantined the city and dispatched its own team of elite soldiers to determine the source of the mysterious outbreak. Caught up in the action are rookie police officer Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield. Players take on the role of an Umbrella Security Service (U.S.S) Soldier and battle against all the competing forces at play in Raccoon City. Choose from six characters, each one equipped with a unique skill set, including the female field scientist Four-Eyes who can manipulate the T-virus and take control of the B.O.W's raiding the streets of Raccoon City or the weapons expert and U.S.S team captain Lupo. Features Team based shooter set in the dark and sinister Resident Evil universe. Triple threat battle as zombies and B.O.W's add an unpredictable twist to the action. Control the truth solo or with up to three friends as an Umbrella Security Service squad member in a story driven Campaign mode. Choose from six U.S.S. characters, each with their own unique skill set and roles. Return of favorite Resident Evil enemies, iconic landmarks and characters, such as Leon S. Kennedy. Rewrite the history of the Raccoon City outbreak. Relive the iconic crash scene from Resident Evil® 2 as Leon S. Kennedy desperately tries to escape from the clutches of the Umbrella Security Services. For the first time ever in Resident Evil history, your character risks infection from the hordes of zombies making their way through the city. Competitive online multiplayer modes provide a unique gaming experience thanks to the triple threat battle between the Umbrella Security Service, US Special Ops and threat of zombies and B.O.W's.]]></description>

	<title><![CDATA[Batman: Arkham City]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[PRODUCT OVERVIEW: Developed by Rocksteady Studios, Batman: Arkham City builds upon the intense, atmospheric foundation of Batman: Arkham Asylum, sending players soaring into Arkham City, the new maximum security “home” for all of Gotham City’s thugs, gangsters and insane criminal masterminds. Set inside the heavily fortified walls of a sprawling district in the heart of Gotham City, this highly anticipated sequel introduces a brand-new story that draws together a new all-star cast of classic characters and murderous villains from the Batman universe, as well as a vast range of new and enhanced gameplay features to deliver the ultimate experience as the Dark Knight. Batman: Arkham City is based on DC Comics’ core Batman license. For more information, visit www.batmanarkhamcity.com. PRODUCT FEATURES: Become the Dark Knight – Batman: Arkham City delivers a genuinely authentic Batman experience with advanced, compelling gameplay on every level: high-impact street brawls, nail-biting stealth, multifaceted forensic investigation, epic super-villain encounters and unexpected glimpses into Batman’s tortured psychology. Play as Catwoman – Catwoman is a fully playable character in Batman: Arkham City who has her own storyline in the main game which is seamlessly interwoven with Batman’s story arc. Her navigation skills, combat moves and gadgetry have been specifically designed to deliver a fully featured and unique experience. Advanced FreeFlow Combat – Batman faces highly coordinated, simultaneous attacks from every direction as Arkham’s gangs bring heavy weapons and all-new AI to the fight, but Batman steps it up with twice the number of combat animations and double the range of attacks, counters and takedowns. New Gadgets – Batman has access to new gadgets such as the Cryptographic Sequencer V2 and Smoke Pellets, as well as new functionality for existing gadgets that expand the range of Batman’s abilities without adding extra weight to his Utility Belt. New Story – Five-time Emmy-Award-winner Paul Dini returns to pen a brand-new story for Batman: Arkham City, taking gamers deep inside the diseased heart of Gotham. Arkham Has Moved – Following the closure of Arkham Asylum and Blackgate prison, Gotham’s new mayor, Quincy Sharp ordered the relocation of all inmates to Arkham City - a sprawling new super-prison five times bigger than Arkham Island, enclosing a wide variety of industrial districts, iconic locations and Gotham landmarks. Huge Cast of Characters – Players encounter numerous characters from the Batman universe, including Catwoman, Two-Face, Harley Quinn, Penguin, Hugo Strange, Victor Zsasz, Calendar Man, The Joker, The Riddler and other iconic characters yet to be revealed.

	<title><![CDATA[Dragon's Dogma™]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[Dragon’s Dogma® is an exciting new franchise which redefines the action genre from the team that produced some of Capcom's greatest action games. Set in a huge open world, Dragon's Dogma offers an exhilarating and fulfilling action combat game with the freedom to explore and interact in a rich, living and breathing world. Alongside your party of three, you set out to track down and destroy a mysterious dragon. Your teammates fight independently of you, demonstrating prowess and ability they have developed based on traits learned over time from you and your actions. Dragon's Dogma offers a near endless opportunity to help develop partner characters to fight alongside you. With an epic story and incredible action, Dragon's Dogma is set to be one of Capcom's newest hit franchises. Key Features: Highly Stylized Action Combat - The creators of this game were responsible for the action hits - Resident Evil® 4 and Devil May Cry® 4. Fight With Ability - The soul of combat comes down to how the game is played, where you strike the enemy, and how you react to their attacks. Accessible Depth - Bringing an unprecedented level of depth to the action genre, every decision has an effect on gameplay in an intuitive way that does not require micromanagement. The weight of your weapon, the material of your armor - even the length of your legs - plays a role in how you fight your battles, but does not interrupt the flow of the action. Epic Adventure - Dragon's Dogma is built from the ground up as an action experience for consoles with a continuous, epic storyline that stands alone in style, scope and substance. Open World - Utilizing Capcom's proprietary MT Framework engine and the groundbreaking graphical styles and lighting effects used in Resident Evil® 5 and Lost Planet® 2, Dragon's Dogma expands the environment to create a vast, richly detailed world, ripe for exploration. A Rich Population - In addition to interacting with hundreds of fully voiced NPCs, you'll be able to fight a large variety of creatures, from goblins to griffins and dragons. Each enemy requires a different strategy and provides a unique experience.]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[Set against the backdrop of the Old World, two adventurers--both seasoned warriors--will quest across a Western Europe ablaze with the turmoil of a newly begun Fourth Crusade.  Denz, a holy Templar, and Esteban, a roguish mercenary, may have different origins, but their motivations are the same: amidst the danger and despair of a new Crusade, to find the means to deliver themselves from a terrible curse that threatens to consume their immortal souls. Embark on a contentious quest for retribution spanning five chapters and over 30 missions that promises to bring fire, death, and destruction to the great cities of medieval Europe. Transform the world around you into a flaming red vision of Hell, increasing your strength and your ability to perceive hidden things, all at the expense of your humanity. Split-screen or online, recruit a friend to assume control of the thief, Esteban, to join in the excitement of shared adventure. Easy to grasp yet deep in its execution, a weapon-based combat engine features over 90 combos, dozens of weapons, and a timing-based counter system.]]></description>

	<title><![CDATA[Shoot Many Robots™]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[Shoot Many Robots™ is a 4-player co-op run-n-gun action shooter that throws you into a tidal wave of degenerate robots with an array of weaponry that would make any shooter enthusiast proud. Players take control of P. Walter Tugnut (The “P” stands for “Pickles”), a hillbilly who stockpiles guns, ammo, and beer in his dilapidated RV awaiting the inevitable robot apocalypse. When the abandoned factory in the distance begins producing robots on its own, Walter sets off in his RV on a robot-killing rampage, hoping to save humanity from an onslaught of robot hordes. Developed by Demiurge Studios, collaborators on Borderlands™, Brothers in Arms®, and Mass Effect™. KEY FEATURES Run-n-Gun A classic 2.5D side-scrolling shooter, revitalized with modern game design. 4-Player Co-op Four players online and up to two players locally can work together to take down the robot armies. Character Customization Players can equip Walter with countless combinations of items to tailor to their play style. Players also level up and gain XP by killing robots, which grants them access to new missions and equipment, as well as increase Walter’s damage and health. Missions Push forward through robot territory in Traversal missions – huge levels that end in epic robot boss battles. Hunker down in Survival missions – claustrophobic levels where the only object is to outlast waves of robot hordes. For the truly hardcore, there are three difficulty modes to keep players hurting. Diversified Combat Take two weapons with you into battle – but it's going to be a tough choice. Revolvers, rocket launchers, assault rifles, flamethrowers, SMGs, and shotguns all beg to be used, not to mention the freeze ray, gnome launcher, and a cat carrier that shoots an exploding robot decoy. With melee combat, players can (and should) punch robots to knock them back and inflict damage. Rockets shot by robots can also be punched, if timed correctly, back into their metal faces. Nut Up, Gear Up, Power Up Nuts are dropped by robots when they are killed, and are used to buy new weapons and gear. Robots occasionally drop power-ups that temporarily grant superhuman powers. These power-ups can turn the tide and reward players for high combos. Robots with Personality Numerous robots – from tiny chainsaw-wielding Choppers to gigantic fire-spewing Fatboys – all have unique personalities, AI, and unique ways to kill, with even fiercer models appearing as the difficulty ramps up.]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[Vincent likes his girlfriend. Katherine's pretty, smart, and successful. Trouble is, she's starting to talk about long-term commitment, something Vincent's spent his entire life avoiding. Since romantic complications are the last thing he wants to deal with, Vincent meets his friends for their regular night of drinks. Little does he know that he's about to be blindsided by a beautiful, seductive, irresistible freight train named Catherine. Suddenly, he's hung over in bed next to the most beautiful woman he's ever seen, unsure about the previous night's events. Was it just making out, he wonders, or did something more serious happen between them? Should he tell Katherine? Will he ever see Catherine again? Vincent's about to find that a stumble on the staircase of love can turn into a horrific, fatal plummet... Key Features The Horrors of Love--Vincent's waking fears, doubts, pressures, and growing guilt about commitment and fidelity now gleefully follow him into his dreams, manifesting as horribly disfigured monsters and a ticking clock. Between a Rock and a Soft Place--The player must navigate Vincent through heavy moral decisions. As in real life, hardly anything is black and white. What is the value of honesty? What is the right thing to do? Either way, someone's going to get hurt. Worse yet, someone could die. The Nightmare of Your Dreams--Under the watch of producer Katsura Hashino, acclaimed director of Persona 3 and Persona 4, famed character artist Shigenori Soejima and master composer Shoji Meguro create sights and sounds unlike anything else. As unforgettable and original as the game's narrative, Catherine's visual direction and musical score define and perfectly complement Vincent's terrifying ascent into the dizzying perils of love. Escape With or From a Friend--Local competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes, in addition to leaderboards, ensure that the many thrills and horrors of racing through twisted stages can be enjoyed by more than one player and add hours of extra gameplay to the overall experience.]]></description>

	<title><![CDATA[El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[Long ago, when the seed of mankind was first taking root, God laid down his plans for the human race. He appointed the Grigori, the most human of all angels in heaven, to watch over them from the celestial realm. The Grigori, known to some as the "The Watchers", dutifully continued their vigilance through the ages. Over time, they became fascinated by the lives humans led, with the uninhibited freedom and passions. Subtle at first, the fascination soon led to feeling of longing, desire and lust. Until one fateful day, the Grigori turned away from God and descended to Earth. When Heaven's highest order, the Council of Elders, discovered the Grigori's betrayal, they were furious. Their anger only grew stronger when they learned that the Fallen Angels had taken in daughters of men, deviating mankind from God's great plan. To set matters right, the Council decided to send a terrible flood to wipe out the entire human race. However, there was one man who objected to the Council's decision. His name was Enoch, a scribe whose righteousness moved God to bring him to Heaven while still living mortal. The Council heard Enoch's pleas and agreed to spare mankind on the condition that Enoch capture the fallen angels and bring them back to Heaven to be imprisoned. To prevent the impending flood, Enoch returned to Earth on a mission to escort the Fallen Angels back to Heaven. Upon his arrival he confronted Azazel, one of the seven who fell. However, Azazel refused to return to Heaven and went into hiding along with the others, warning Enoch not to follow. And so, Enoch's long journey begins... Expect the unexpected. El Shaddai defies gaming convention by mixing a wide variety of game play styles including 2D side-scrolling action and 3D exploration. Lose yourself in the compelling storyline based on the ancient apocryphal tome, The Book of Enoch, but told with a modern flare and uniquely artistic approach. Innovative Zero HUD Player Feedback System' utilizes dynamic environment, character, and audio clues to keep the player engaged without cluttering the screen with extraneous indicators and information. The three-button control system is simple to use yet surprisingly deep, delivering exhilarating, flowing action that allows both casual and hardcore players to enjoy the game at their own pace. Fluid environments with constantly dynamic elements create a flowing living world filled with a wide variety of unusual landscapes unlike anything previously seen in gaming. This is enhanced by high production value cinematic cut scenes to an inspirational full orchestral music score. All weapons are forged from crystalline heavenly knowledge beyond the grasp of humanity and possess supernatural powers. Among them is the Arch, a holy blade with the hidden power to slice through anything.]]></description>

You can suck up bullets with your hose and whip enemies with your cord. Two players can team-up. A well-balanced scoring system gives added equilibrium. As a boy reads from his favorite fairy tale, a fairy appears from the book and requests his help against an evil wizard who has been tampering with the stories.

Graphically, all the enemies, bullets, explosions are beautifully designed sprites, which constantly scale, rotate and pulsate. The game has a very lively feel.

	<title><![CDATA[Rapid Angel]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[Japanese developer Techo Soleil has a knack for creating games with sophisticated charm and nuance. Rapid Angel fits the mold. This combination beat-em up and platformer has something special for those with a subtle eye for Japanese ingenuity. The graphics are very stylish and well-crafted. The game play goes back to the old days of running, jumping and fighting, picking up gems and coins for points and food to replenish your life. You can choose between three anime girls to be your heroine, each with her own fighting style. The characters all have personality and anime fans will feel the love with their voice. That anime humor is present too--like the sweatdrops appearing on you and the enemy when the enemy does something totally awkward or strange. You’ll find yourself laughing at the character antics.

	<description><![CDATA[Command the lightning and the storm as Thor Play as Thor™: God of Thunder, in an epic-scale action adventure as Thor battles to save his home of Asgard. Wielding the iconic Mjölnir, Thor’s legendary hammer, fight across multiple Norse worlds, controlling elemental storm powers to overcome hordes of deadly foes with devastating lightning bolts, earthshaking thunder, and mighty blasts of wind that can sweep away throngs of enemies. Battle through mythological realms to overcome colossal enemies lifted from the pages of the comics, including Ulik, Ymir, and Surtur, in a clash that extends to extraordinary planets filled with Frost Giants, Trolls and other mammoth opponents. Use powerful melee combos, lethal hammer throws, godlike elemental powers and a robust grappling system to take down enemies that range from large to gigantic: go toe-to-toe with a 25-foot tall, 12-ton Ice Troll for a truly heart-pumping experience. In the midst of massive action, there’s still room for strategic choices. Level up Thor’s abilities as you earn Valor points, customizing your powers from the skill tree. Smash opponent armor to reveal weak spots and disable weapons. Manage the Odinforce resource that powers your elemental attacks, building up reserves for taking down level bosses. Choose between lightning-fast Tap and slow but powerful Charge options for finishing moves and storm powers, weighing the speed, damage and Odinforce cost of different attacks to fit battle conditions. The game’s compelling original storyline was overseen by Eisner Award-winning writer and lead Thor comic book author Matt Fraction. Chris Hemsworth, who also plays Thor in the film adaptation, voices the title role while Tom Hiddleston portrays Loki. With big action, battling Norse gods, and Hollywood production values, Thor™: God of Thunder is an interactive experience that’s larger than life in every sense. Features: Become the God of Thunder: Step into the role of Thor, the son of Asgard’s ruler, Odin, and wield the mighty hammer Mjölnir while controlling the devastating powers of the storm. Epic Enemies: Use multiple strategies including grappling, vaulting, and elemental attacks to take on an array of titanic Norse enemies dozens of feet tall and weighing over 20 tons. Massive Combat: Use brawn, brains and primal storm powers as you bludgeon trolls, knock down distant opponents with hammer throws, immobilize dangerous foes with lightning, scale massive giants using multiple grappling points to attack weak spots, and blow pesky assailants off ledges with blasts of wind. Level Up: Choose new abilities, powers, and weapon upgrades as Thor earns Valor runes through battle victories. Four Unique Worlds: Journey to four different Norse planets, each with different challenges to explore, adventures to undertake and enemies to conquer. Powerful Original Storyline: Delve deeper into the heroic tales of the Thor universe with an original video game story overseen by Thor comic book author Matt Fraction. Comic Book Icon: Brought to the Marvel Universe by Stan Lee and penciled by noted artist Jack Kirby, Thor has appeared in hundred of comics (solo and with the Avengers) and dozens of TV episodes—now he stars in his first video game and major motion picture. Star Power: Chris Hemsworth stars as Thor while Tom Hiddleston plays his treacherous brother Loki, ensuring they face off with real emotion in the game while providing character continuity between the video game and film adaptations.]]></description>

	<title><![CDATA[Money Idol Exchanger - Japan Import]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[The genre of stacked objects continually falling to fill up the screen while you fight the deluge by mixing and matching objects can be remembered as the great age of puzzle twitchers. Money Idol Exchanger is exactly this genre but with some Idol love to help you through the maze. With names like Mightdealer, Debtmiser, Everyworker, and Cherrybiter, the girls are of that special Japanese flavor with lots of cuteness. But the game's quality comes through on the two-player versus mode. Like all the great drop games, the intensity of the battle mode is where a game makes its grade and this game performs like scholar. The fact that you have to do some addition while you're burning your buddy makes the victory somehow sweeter. Not only are you a better player, you're smarter too! Please Note: this game is a direct import from Japan. Although text is limited, it is presented in its original Japanese form. Help can be found at www.monkeypawgames.com]]></description>

	<title><![CDATA[Dead Rising® 2]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[Several years have passed since the original Dead Rising®, and while Frank West was able to save America from a zombie apocalypse, the cause of zombification was not completely contained. In Dead Rising® 2, continued zombie outbreaks have occurred throughout the United States and it is your job to stop them. New locale: Dead Rising 2 shifts the action from the everyday world of mid-West America to the glitz and glamor of Fortune City, America's latest and greatest entertainment playground. People flock to Fortune City from around the globe to escape from reality and the chance to win big. New character: Play as former national Motocross champion Chuck Greene. Before he hit the big time with a team and sponsorship behind him, Chuck was forced to repair his own bikes, leaving him incredibly resourceful and a real handyman. A single father, Chuck dotes on his daughter Katey who he will do anything for since the loss of her mother. More zombies and weapons: With hundreds of zombies on screen at any one time, the original Dead Rising forced gamers to turn everyday objects they found in a mall into improvised weapons capable of fending off attacks. Now, Dead Rising 2 increases the carnage with even more zombies intent on feasting on human flesh, and countless new objects with which Chuck can make the undead dead. Development pedigree: Dead Rising 2 is being developed by Canadian developer Blue Castle Games in close collaboration with Capcom. A number of members from the original Dead Rising team will be working alongside Blue Castle Games throughout the development process, including Capcom's global head of research and development Keiji Inafune, who serves as the game's producer.]]></description>

	<title><![CDATA[Tall Unlimited - Japan Import]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[The object of Tall Unlimited is to build your towers as fast as you can, as high as you can. The game is an arcade romp through 8 stages where you have to complete 10 levels in each stage. The gameplay is fast and furious but the complexity is intuitive and the feel is responsive. So the game comes off refreshingly fun and original. Its addictive action and minimal frustration blends with a creative building element that pulls you in. Like potato chips, once you start you won’t want to stop. Tall Unlimited was originally published by Techno Soleil and developed by Open Sesame in 1999. The game was published first in Japan and later made into a North American release in 2002, called Tall Infinity. This version is the original Japanese version, hence the original name. Please Note: this game is a direct import from Japan. Although text is limited, it is in the original Japanese language. Help can be found at www.monkeypawgames.com]]></description>

	<title><![CDATA[Arcade Hits: Outlaws of the Lost Dynasty - Japan Import]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[The story is based in feudal China, like so many fighters of that era. But what separates the game from others is its hand-to-hand combat play. If you wish to throw down your weapon and fight like a man, you’re efforts will be paid off in more visceral attacks and better combos. This is a nice flight from others in the genre as it adds a twist where you may not expect. Outlaws of the Lost Dynasty is standard 2D fighting fare with quarter circles, charge moves, combos, and special moves. Like most Data East fighters, the depth lies in the linking together of standard and special attacks, and pulling off what air juggling is possible within the system. The character animation in this series is particularly smooth and fluid for the time, and while it’s certainly not a modern fighter, it holds up surprisingly well. Please Note: this game is a direct import from Japan. Although text is limited, it is in Japanese. Help with playing can be found at www.monkeypawgames.com]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[Super Stacker for the PSN knocks the block off the acclaimed flash version! This new version includes the original game plus 2 never-before-seen play modes, over 100 levels, competitive leaderboard rankings, badges, multiplayer, and HD graphics that utilize the power of the PS3. Super Stacker keeps the addictive gameplay of the original, then injects steroids and makes it a game that has never been done on the web. The premise is deceptively simple: Stack your entire queue of blocks onto a given platform without them falling off. If your stack can last more than 10 seconds, you win! Sounds easy, right? Well the grunts and groans of failure and loud screams of victory from countless fans beg to differ. The two never-before-seen modes include Present Stacker: stacking blocks toward a particular ‘goal’, and Unstacker: blasting away dynamite blocks! That’s right, you get to blow stuff up!]]></description>

	<title><![CDATA[God of War® III]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[IN THE END, THERE WILL BE ONLY CHAOS™... Developed exclusively for the PLAYSTATION®3 system (PS3™) system, God of War® III is the final installment of the multi-million unit-selling trilogy. Developed by Sony Computer Entertainment’s Santa Monica Studios, God of War III will bring epic battles to life with stunning graphics and an elaborate plot that puts Kratos at the center of carnage and destruction as he seeks revenge against the Gods who have betrayed him. Set in the realm of brutal Greek mythology, God of War III is a single-player game that allows players to take on the climatic role of the ex-Spartan warrior, Kratos, as he scales through the intimidating heights of Mt. Olympus and the dark depths of Hell to seek revenge on those who have betrayed him. Armed with double-chained blades, and an array of new weapons and magic for this iteration of the trilogy, Kratos must take on mythology’s darkest creatures while solving intricate puzzles throughout his merciless quest to destroy Olympus. Key Features ONLY ON THE PS3 SYSTEM - The award-winning development team leverages the processing power and technology of PLAYSTATION 3 system to make God of War III one of the most-graphically advanced next gen titles available, with even the dramatic cut screens running off the in-game engine. GROUNDBREAKING DEPTH OF SCALE – Kratos will explore areas up to 4 times larger than those found in God of War II, as well as carve through entire armies while navigating on the back of Titans - living, moving, breathing levels as tall as the Empire State Building. STYLIZED REALISM – Players will battle in detailed and unique 3D worlds lit by thousands of dynamic lights and textures with quadruple the resolution, which allows for realistic muscle striations, detailed facial expressions, and new heightened levels of brutality and gore. SIGNATURE GAMEPLAY - Brutal combat, intricate puzzles, exploration of awe-inspiring worlds, and a compelling and satisfying ending to Kratos’ epic story. SOPHISTICATED STORYLINE – The God of War III storyline is the epic conclusion to the trilogy; the storyline will be told in a way that is true to traditionalist roots in Greek mythology, from moral consequences to brutal battles against the Gods. RIDEABLE CREATURES – Several of the menacing creatures of Greek mythology in God of War III can now be manipulated against their will, as Kratos uses them to cross chasms, inflict blind rage against enemies, reveal puzzles and secrets, and as tools of complete annihilation. NEW WEAPONS AND COMBAT SYSTEM - New deadly weapons such as the Cestus -- powerful metal gauntlets with devastating strength -- and other brutal instruments of war that will allow Kratos to learn ruthless new techniques such as grappling with enemies and launching explosive wall-to-ground attacks. LIGHTING TECHNOLOGIES – The dynamic lighting solution employed in GOW III is only feasible through the computing power provided by the Cell SPUs. For example, using the High Dynamic Range Lighting (HDRL) technology, the camera – when using Krato’s sightline - will emulate the human retina, causing players to feel a sharp brightness when Kratos exits a dark area and enters a sunlit area, similar to how the human eye would need to adjust.]]></description>

	<title><![CDATA[PixelJunk® Shooter]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[In PixelJunk™ Shooter, players pilot a subterranean exploration vehicle to explore the interior of diverse cave-like complexes. The player must affect the surrounding and dynamic terrain to progress. The goal is to safely navigate through each vivid stage and rescue survivors scattered about the cavernous environment. Each stage is in-effect a flow simulation whereby the player attempts to control various types of liquid (water, magma, etc) and solid matter (rock, earth) either by destroying it, manipulating it or moving it. These dynamic fluid effects are at the heart of the game’s visuals. Strategy is paramount in PixelJunk™ Shooter. The piloted craft is susceptible to extremes of heat, so the player must be careful about the craft’s proximity to magma. If the craft becomes too hot, the player can regain a comfortable temperature by plunging into the nearest water source. Additionally, each stage presents a puzzle scenario for the player to solve in order to safely rescue as many survivors as possible. Both environmental elements and enemies, including Bosses, will attempt to hamper the player’s progress. PixelJunk™ Shooter is the fourth game in Q-Games’ PixelJunk series, which blends simple, addictive gameplay with crisp and attractive graphics designed for optimal viewing in full 1080p High Definition. KEY FEATURES Distinctive Visuals and Music – Features several unique stages with stylishly designed graphics and original music. Fluid Dynamics and Effects – The dynamic rendition of water, magma and other substances is the visual centerpiece in PixelJunk™ Shooter Stages as Puzzles - Players attempt to change the terrain and environment around them to progress. It often takes strategy, planning and old-fashioned trial and error to succeed. Online Rankings and YouTube Uploading – Share your scores and game footage with the world. Rumble Support – Feel the effects when the craft bumps into the cavern’s wall. Remote Play – Supports Remote Play for PSP® system. Trophy Support – PixelJunk™ Shooter will fully support PlayStation Trophies.]]></description>

From a house in the city, journey to a series of worlds and solve puzzles to rescue an abducted princess.

	<title><![CDATA[Need For Speed™ Shift]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[Need for Speed™ SHIFT is an award-winning authentic racing game that combines the true driver’s experience with real-world physics, pixel-perfect car models, and a wide range of authentic race tracks. Need for Speed SHIFT takes players in a different direction to create a simulation experience that replicates the true feeling of driving high-end performance cars. Players are thrust into the loud, visceral, intense, athletic experience of racing a car on the edge of control from the driver’s perspective through the combination of perception based G-forces, the hyper reality of the cockpit view, and the brutal experience of a first person crash dynamic. Need for Speed SHIFT features an accurate, accessible physics-based driving model that allows you to feel every impact, every change of track surface and every last bit of grip as you push yourself to the edge. The all-new driver profile is the ultimate extension of the true driver’s experience. This system gives each player a unique persona based on a player’s driving skill and style - aggressive or precise. Driver profile impacts how a player unlocks cars, overall career progression and online matchmaking. In Need for Speed SHIFT, how you drive is who you are behind the wheel. Need for Speed SHIFT is being developed by Slightly Mad Studios in collaboration with Black Box and senior vice president Patrick Soderlund at EA Games Europe. Slightly Mad Studios includes developers and designers that worked on the critically acclaimed games GT Legends and GTR 2. Features True Driver’s Experience – A variety of visual cues delivers the true driver’s experience including a three-dimensional HUD that mimics driver head movement, inertia and G-forces. The depth of field also adjusts based on the speed of the car; so when the car is travelling at high speeds the perspective will shift to the distance putting the car/cockpit out of focus. Driver Profile – What kind of driver are you? Driver profile tracks the player’s evolution as a race driver from event to event. This system is made up of a driver’s personality on the track, their success rate and any profile points and badges accrued all of which work together to create a tailor-made career and gameplay experience. Driver profile is pervasive throughout all modes: career and online. Dynamic Crash Effect - When the player hits a static object or opponent car, the player will feel like they are 'taking damage'. A combination of visual and audio effects will leave the player disorientated and briefly disrupt the race. Total Customization – Need for Speed SHIFT features a comprehensive customization option that lets the player tailor every aspect of the cars performance and styling. Go under the hood to upgrade and tune your vehicle to increase its performance. The visual customization system allows players to personalize both the exterior and trick out the interior to reflect their individual style and preferences. Photo Real Cars and Tracks – Nearly 70 licensed cars are available including the Pagani Zonda F, Audi RS4, and Porsche 911 GT3 RSR. There is also over 15 real-world locations like Willow Springs and Laguna Seca as well as fictional circuits like downtown London and Tokyo.]]></description>

	<title><![CDATA[Trash Panic™]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE) gives new meaning to “waste management” with a brand new puzzle game that combines strategy and frenzied action with … well, garbage. Taking the puzzle video game genre one step further, Trash Panic™ is the newest PS3 downloadable exclusive that tasks players to compact as much garbage into a trash can before it overflows, and in the most “eco-friendly” way as possible. Throughout each stage, random trash items will be delivered via crane to players who can then manipulate the speed and direction they fall using the DualShock 3 controller. The trash can will quickly reach full capacity unless the trash is broken down or dealt with by strategically using various elements given throughout each stage. Items will continue to be dropped until the player successfully compacts a certain number of items or ends up with an overflowing trash can. Each level will also feature a giant Boss item that players need to destroy in a certain amount of time to avoid getting penalized. At the end of each stage, each player will be rated by how “eco-friendly” or “ego-friendly” each stage was completed. The more “eco-friendly,” the higher the rating. Ratings help in unlocking various levels and modes. Spread across three different game modes, Trash Panic offers fun gaming for everyone. The Main Mode will take players progressively through six stages that increase in difficulty the further you advance. Vs. Mode allows two players to battle one another on the same screen. And lastly, Mission Mode offers mini-games for those who want to further their fun with a variety of waste management missions. Trash Panic also offers ways for players to show off their skills with trophy support and online learderboards. Additionally, players will have a recording option to upload up to 10 minutes of a gaming session onto YouTube to share with the rest of the world! KEY FEATURES Eco-Friendly Gaming – Trash Panic’s eco-conscious theme provides a new take on gaming while making players more aware of “environmentally friendly” ways to dispose waste. Accessible Controls – Using the DualShock3 controller, Trash Panic’s pick-up-and-play controls allow for immediate fun for hours for both casual and hard-core gamers. Addictive Gameplay – The unique setting and strategic game objective allows for endless hours and addictive gameplay, as well as competition in a social setting. YouTube Upload Feature – With a recording option embedded in the game, Trash Panic allows players to show off their strategies and skills with the rest of the world through one of the biggest social networking sites. Vs. Mode – Supports 1-2 players locally. Players can either battle against the computer or test their skills against a friend. Online Rankings and Trophy Support – Leaderboards and trophies will motivate players to aspire to both single player and multiplayer high scores!]]></description>

	<title><![CDATA[Cross Edge]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[Cross Edge is an unprecedented collaboration between five major game publishers from Japan. Nippon Ichi Software, Capcom, Namco Bandai, Gust, and Idea Factory have joined forces to create a Strategy RPG unlike any other. Cross Edge features characters and storylines from popular franchises including: Darkstalkers, Disgaea, Mana Khemia, and Spectral Souls. Cross Edge is action-packed with memorable characters, amazing items, and over-the top battles to deliver an once-in-a-lifetime gaming experience. Cross Edge combines classic RPG combat with a grid-based Strategy RPG combat to create a hybrid battle system. In combat, a square grid will appear beneath the units. Some units are better at close combat and others at a distance, so players must strategically move their units to battle enemies. In combat, some units can toss up enemies and chain combo various moves for extra damage, like in a fighting game. By using characters from Gust titles, players can use alchemy to craft weapons. Change costumes to increase character’s stats and abilities, and in some cases “revealing” cut scenes. Explore dungeons to run, jump and attack.]]></description>

The Don of your family is killed in Cuba, leaving it to you to take the reigns and lead your battered organization and reestablish the Corleone powerbase in Queens.

The game takes place within 6 infinite play arenas with 3 modes in each plus 10 challenges that provide alternate styles of play.

Experience Be part of a full scale war on a new world - a world more hostile than any you’ve ever seen before!

	<title><![CDATA[Flower®]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[The pioneers that brought you the award-winning PSN title flOw are back with another concept that challenges traditional gaming conventions. Flower expands the team’s tradition of delivering simple gameplay, accessible controls and a medium to explore emotional chords uncommon in video games. In Flower, the surrounding environment, most often pushed to the background in games, is pulled to the forefront and becomes the primary “character.” The player fades from an external and stressful world in the opening of this fresh and genuine game and journeys through beautifully vivid landscapes, changing the surroundings and exploring nature along the way. Playing as the wind, the player guides and grows a swarm of petals by interacting with other flowers and the surrounding environment. The goals and journey in each level vary, but all involve flight, exploration and interaction with the level. Using SIXAXIS™ motion sensors, the player guides the lead petal and accumulates a swarm of flower petals as he moves at his own pace within the environment, causing the on-screen world to change. Flower's gameplay offers different experiences, pacing and rhythm to all players. Along the way, the environment will pose challenges to the player’s progress. Both pastoral and at times chaotic, Flower is a visual, audio and interactive escape. Key Features: Now available on PS4™, PS3™, and PS Vita systems. Purchase on one system and receive the other versions at no additional cost. Simple Gameplay Controls – Controlling the game is as simple as tilting the DUALSHOCK wireless controller's in the direction you want to go. Lush and Interactive Environments – Vast grassy fields, blowing in the breeze, create a lush, immersive environment. Immersive and Emotional – Accessible to gamers and non-gamers alike, the game takes players on an incredibly personal and emotional experience.]]></description>

Players meet on a blue and green planet scattered with individual plots – and use their character’s amazing abilities to play, create and share what they build with other gamers throughout the world via PlayStation®Network. The LittleBigPlanet experience starts with players learning about their character’s powers to interact physically with the environment. There are places to explore, creative resources to collect and puzzles to solve – all requiring a combination of brains and collaborative teamwork. As soon as players begin their creative skills will grow and they will soon be ready to start creating and modifying their surroundings – the first step to sharing them with the whole community. Characters have the power to move anything in this glued and stitched-together 3D landscape; they have the power to design, shape and build both objects and entire locations for others to view and play. There’s no complicated level editor; all of these skills can be learned by simply playing the game. Creativity is part of the gameplay experience and playing is part of the creative experience. Players can make their world as open or as secretive to explore as they like. When it’s ready, they can invite anyone within the LittleBigPlanet community to come and explore their patch – or can go and explore everybody else’s. KEY FEATURES There’s not just one way to play. Players craft their own individual experience based on their own creativity. Unlimited possibilities for user-created content – players can customize everything: their characters, the landscape around them and their own patch on LittleBigPlanet. Players learn new skills and discover new items to aid them on their creative journey Explore the massive single player game or go online to find user-generated content. LittleBigPlanet will change every day as players contribute their own levels. Online and offline multiplayer modes – play alone, work as a team or get competitive.

These are just a few samples of the possibilities for Terrain Deformation. Players not only change the battlefield – they change the face of the battle itself.]]></description>

In the new puzzle game Elefunk™, your elephants must traverse 20 levels of ravines, rivers, fire pits and swamps – and they’ll only get across if you strengthen the structures correctly with metal, wood and rope. It’s real construction with realistic physics and three different game modes: Time Attack, Puzzle, and Deconstruction. Get building today! Game Modes: Puzzle Mode – Beginning with an empty level, the player constructs a structure using the limited number of pieces given. There is no time limit, and the next level is unlocked when the player successfully aids the elephant in traversing the level’s ravine. Time Attack – This mode is played on previously unlocked levels. The player begins with a partially constructed structure and has to finish the structure with the limited materials given in a certain time limit. Once the counter reaches zero, the elephants are released! Deconstruction Multiplayer – This two-player mode can be played either on-or-offline. In each round, a player tries to remove a piece of the structure that is holding an elephant without causing the elephant to fall. When a player causes the elephant to fall, the round is over and a point is awarded to his opponent. When all rounds have been played, a winner is declared.]]></description>

	<title><![CDATA[Overlord: Raising Hell]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[Are You Evil or Really Evil? Look inside your heart and ask yourself – are you evil, or really evil? Prepare to wreak havoc and unleash your minion horde with Overlord Raising Hell! Your Dark Tower lies in ruins. Your power, once absolute, is in tatters. The peasants who once cowered away from you live under the rule of ‘heroes’ who took your kingdom from you. Unicorns gallop gaily through sun-kissed meadows. Orcs, Goblins, Dwarves and Halflings live side by side. This, clearly, is unacceptable. It’s time to take back what’s rightfully yours as you step into the role of the Overlord and look into your jet-black heart to find out whether you’re evil or really evil. Overlord Raising Hell’s triumphant debut on PLAYSTATION&reg;3 takes you on a seriously twisted fantasy adventure packed with dark humour and smart satire on established RPG convention and cliché. Penned by game writer Rhianna Pratchett, acclaimed author on Heavenly Sword&trade;, prepare to embark on a tongue-in-cheek journey of death and destruction where evil is enlightening and tyranny’s a treat. Playing as the once-mighty Overlord, you’ll have to rebuild your Dark Tower into the ultimate symbol of your absolute power and reassert your dominance over the kingdom assisted by an army of up to 50 crazed minions. These slavishly loyal, gremlin-esque critters are predisposed to violence, often drunk, but always ready and willing to take on even the most suicidal order – whether it’s pillaging villages for kicks, giggles and booty or hurling themselves at enemies in the face of kamikaze odds. Controlling the minions is a slick operation, requiring a mere flick of the right analogue stick to send a swarm into battle. They’re resourceful, even charming, little lunatics, able to arm themselves with axes and swords from fallen enemies and dress themselves with scavenged armour – even if their loyalty is not matched by their intellect. It’s not unknown for them to rush into combat wearing a pumpkin as a helmet or brandishing a zombie arm as a club. Effective? No. Funny? Oh yes. As you re-establish your authority you’ll conquer lands and battle deranged bosses like Melvin Underbelly, a morbidly obese glutton who wields a giant gold fork as a weapon or Goldo Golderson, a boozy dwarf who rides into battle on a huge steam roller. This entire evil endeavour comes with its own rewards of course, and your Dark Tower rises from the ruins to become a monolithic citadel of treasure and trophies, a place to forge new weapons and, naturally, the home of a lavish boudoir to stash your mistress. As the Overlord, just how evil you choose to be is reflected in the game world as you’re presented with various choices; do you stick with your first mistress, or take another? Do you free villagers under your command or order your minions to crush them ruthlessly underfoot? The extent of your evil is reflected in your appearance, with spikes growing from your jet black armour, a convenient corruption meter that neatly records your misdemeanours and the way characters react to you – whether it’s (mistakenly!) welcoming you as a hero, cowering away from you as you pass or even offering you their first-born daughters as a bribe for protection! Overlord Raising Hell on PLAYSTATION&reg;3 includes both the original game and the huge Raising Hell expansion which takes you deeper into the Overlord’s warped world with a series of additional levels, each a supernatural abyss for the game’s five kingdoms. With the undead denizens of each abyss on the attack and threatening your supremacy, there’s only one thing for it; assemble the minions, descend into each abyss and embark on a fresh wave of tyranny to become the Overlord of the underworld. A host of other improvements come on this packed Blu-ray Disc&trade;, including online co-op play and head-to-head slaughter with enhanced visuals, top specification 7.1 surround sound support and a slew of gameplay refinements including an on-screen mini-map.]]></description>

Providing players with some additional performance incentives, the MLB® franchise introduces the new Progressive Batting Performance feature, which will both reward players for superior performance and penalize them for hitting slumps. Specific to each individual batter, players will be rewarded with slight contact bonuses, or punished with slight decreases in contact, based on how that batter that performs beyond his "natural ability" while under user control. Adding to the online feature set, which includes customizable Online League Play with up to 30 teams, scrolling MLB® Score Ticker and more, MLB® 08 The Show&trade; introduces SCOUT (SportsConnect Online User Tracking), which allows gamers to set and store their game preferences on the MLB® server, and enables the system to look for a Quick Match with opponents that fits similar competitive criteria.]]></description>

	<title><![CDATA[NBA 08]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[Celebrating a successful introduction with the launch of NBA ’07 on the PLAYSTATION®3, Sony Computer Entertainment America’s San Diego Studio introduced a next-generation basketball experience that delivered smooth, ultra-realistic basketball action. For the first time in any console sports title, NBA ’07 incorporated true 1080p high definition at 60 frames per second (fps) to provide detailed, lifelike graphics and the most engaging gameplay available. This year, NBA ’08 continues to improve on this next-gen hoops formula by further pushing the graphical envelope as well as adding a host of new features and innovative gameplay functionality. To complement the fast-paced basketball action, NBA ’08 introduces an all-new progression system where players earn skill and experience rewards that can be used to thoroughly customize player appearance and play styles. With an upgraded control system from last year that utilizes broader SIXAXIS functionality, gamers can engage in all-new and comprehensive gameplay movement on and off the ball. Also for this year, character models are updated with new animations, more dynamic movement, and new skin textures to give them a more realistic look. Additionally, the user interface has been significantly revamped to incorporate a retro NBA look and feel – from the menus down to the loading screens. To submerse gamers in a true basketball atmosphere, NBA ’08 introduces for the first time a comprehensive and in-depth audio commentary with top broadcast talent. With a fully reworked user interface, revamped character models and environments, and a robust online system with player profiles and quick play options, NBA ’08 is set to push the envelope for NBA action and bring an unparalleled basketball experience to the PS3&trade;. KEY FEATURES All-New Progression System – NBA ’08 introduces a new system of rewarding players for game exploration and advancement by providing numerous customizable player options. As gamers play NBA ’08, they will be challenged to complete tasks and goals that will earn experience. In turn, experience can be used to customize characters and show them off as status symbols of game achievement. Reaching higher profile levels will grant access to better gear and unlockable content, and players will be able to house awards in a virtual trophy room. Greater Online Accessibility – Utilizing an online hub where players can readily share game features and data, NBA ’08 provides a streamlined approach for online basketball gaming. For this year, gamers will be able to participate in a social environment where they can easily show off custom created players and gain access to streaming NBA video, player-created pages, and improved leader boards. NBA Replay Mode – Back to test the skills of the most hardcore NBA fans, “NBA Replay” is once again available for players to re-enact great performances from the ’06 -’07 season and work through the entire past season’s worth of memorable gameplay scenarios. NBA Replay (Games of the Week) – Returning with an all-new set of upcoming highlight-reel plays, “Games of the Week” will allow players to download five scenarios each week involving real NBA games from the upcoming ’07 -’08 season and attempt to replay those magical moments within the game. Brand New Full Audio Commentary – NBA ’08 now delivers the sights and sounds of an NBA broadcast to the user with authentic play-by-play and in-depth color commentary. Newly incorporated audio, cut scenes, and UI elements blend together to transport gamers into a slick and organic NBA-themed world. Enhanced Gameplay and A.I. – In addition to the core fundamentals of gameplay, NBA ’08 improves on team gameplay elements. Offensive and defensive player positioning is more authentic, where players space themselves correctly on offense and defenders react more realistically to shots, layups, and shifts in offense. Passing and catching is revamped to reward users with good shots when a quality pass is made. Additionally, a new game management system requires player strategy to determine play calling, when and who to substitute, and when to call a timeout. Greater SIXAXIS&trade; Controls – Expanded SIXAXIS functionality provides an all-new and deeper set of control options including specific dribbles as well as high and low offensive and defensive moves. Expanded Character Movement – A new contact mechanism takes into account a player’s momentum when pushing into one another, introducing a “physical” (as opposed to finesse) game play mechanic. Additionally, more emphasis is placed on off ball play, where gamers use skills to improve team abilities including reaction time and attention to passing windows. Brand New Animations – Animation variety is significantly increased, featuring a variety of new passing and dribbling styles, defensive postures that include high and wide coverage, as well as new looks for box out and post-up activity. Updated Environments – Arenas given more life with more dynamic movement and animations, particularly with coaches, bench players, and crowd. Enhanced Character Models – Utilizing a refined version of lighting and shader techniques, NBA ’08 produces characters that look more authentic and realistic than ever. Full HD at 1080p – NBA ‘08 continues to deliver true high definition at 60 frames per second, delivering the sharpest and most realistic basketball experience available.]]></description>

	<title><![CDATA[Heavenly Sword®]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[Emotionally charged, stunningly beautiful, and delivering unprecedented dramatic character performance, Heavenly Sword™ showcases the power of PLAYSTATION®3 (PS3™) computer entertainment system. A dramatic tale of revenge sees Nariko, a fiery red-haired heroine, embark on a quest for vengeance against an invading King and his army. The story builds around the ancient Heavenly Sword, which once belonged to a powerful deity. It can never be wielded by a mortal without it slowly but inevitably draining their life-force. When the invading King (played by Andy Serkis) destroys the warrior clan that guards the Heavenly Sword, the clan leader’s daughter, Nariko, takes up the sword in a desperate fight for survival. Nariko must now pay the ultimate price as she embarks on one last mission of vengeance against the King and his army before her life is finally and irreparably overtaken by the omnipotent Heavenly Sword… Key Features The Heavenly Sword – The Heavenly Sword itself can transform into three distinct weapons, each with its own accompanying fighting stance used by Nariko to vary combat styles. The Combat Engine – The combat engine can scale up from sophisticated one-on-one encounters to one-on-many, where enemies employ intelligent squad-based dynamics, right up to combat against battalions pushing real-time gameplay and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to unprecedented new levels. Physics-Based Combat – The physics-based combat allows players to sweep debris against opponents, kick tables to halt an oncoming surge of fighters, smash the enemy into the scenery, or throw bodies into other enemies using “aftertouch” controls. Wide range of Objects & Weaponry – Heavenly Sword provides a wide range of objects & weaponry including rapid fire crossbows and massively damaging bazookas. Creative in-game Cinematography – Coupled with real-time story evolvement and amazing set-pieces, Heavenly Sword feels like a blockbuster action movie that takes combat gameplay to new heights. PLAYSTATION®3 – Greater processing power on the PS3 enables more immersive visuals and sound effects in Heavenly Sword, heightening the character performance and combat within the stunningly beautiful environments.]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[Already widely considered the most authentic baseball simulation available, the franchise now introduces the all-new Road to The Show mode, enabling gamers to play both offense and defense from the created player’s perspective. Providing an even more realistic experience from the mound, the all-new New Pitch Command System (PCS) delivers unsurpassed strategy to pitch selection, as a pitcher’s “pitch comfort” will be predetermined based on a best to worst pitch scenario. It is up the gamer to decide if he/she should try to “work on a pitch” or just go with what is working. Additionally, with the Adaptive Pitching Intelligence (API) feature, catchers will call the game based on the individual strengths and weaknesses of each pitcher as well as analyze tendencies of batters. Gamers will now have the ability to either trust the pitches called by the catcher or shake them off.

	<title><![CDATA[Spider-Man™ 3]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[Unleash the Power of the Black Suit! Based on Sony Pictures Entertainment’s Columbia Pictures’ upcoming feature film, Spider-Man 3 allows players to experience the actions of heroic red-suited Spider-Man and, for the first time ever, his darker, more mysterious black-suited persona. Set in a larger, dynamic, free-roaming New York City, the game gives players the freedom to choose their own gameplay experience through multiple movie-based and original storylines, fully integrated city missions and performance rewards including improved speed, combat maneuvers and agility. In Spider-Man 3, players draw upon Spider-Man’s completely revamped combat abilities as they protect the city and defeat nemeses using expanded aerial fighting, finishing moves and dynamic webbing during missions and epic boss battles. KEY FEATURES Welcome to the dark side – For the first time ever, control the legendary black suit, which magnifies Spider-Man’s strength, agility and durability. Punish your enemies with explosive new attacks and incredible upgrades, including fearsome room-clearers. All this power comes with a price, though, as players will find the black suit harder and harder to control. Will you be strong enough to make a heroic choice before your quest for vengeance turns the city against you? Let freedom ring – Go anywhere at any time in a larger, dynamic, free-roaming New York City and get involved in whatever you want, whenever you want. Players decide how to proceed through the game and set their own goals. Should Spider-Man follow a plot twist, switch to an alternate storyline, fight off crime waves that threaten the city or explore vast interior and underground locations? You decide. The city is your playground – From towering skyscrapers to the vast new subterranean sewers and subways Spider-Man must patrol all of New York. Three criminal gangs and variety of Super Villains will be competing for your attention, taking hostages, stealing cars, harassing citizens, and creating havoc. Will you be able to save everyone? Don’t let the city go to the dogs – Three vicious gangs have laid claim to the boroughs of New York and must be taken down. As Spider-Man brings these criminals to justice, the crime rate will drop in that section of town and city life will return to normal; if he doesn’t, the streets will turn to chaos. These super thugs won’t go down without a fight though. Their advanced AI will surround Spider-Man, grapple him, call in reinforcements, and do everything they can to retake their territory. Everybody was kung-fu fighting – Redesigned from the ground up, the all-new combat system empowers players to perform suit-specific attacks and combo chains to defeat their enemies and complete challenges and missions. New animations, combos, and finishers make punch, kick, and web attacks more effective than ever while executing ground and air maneuvers. Super Villains galore – Experience multi-stage, dynamic boss battles against the headlining villains from the movie as well as a host of legendary comic book foes who all take advantage of their environments, their minions, and the large-scale destruction that their superpowers cause in trying to defeat Spider-Man. Go, go gadget – In addition to faster web-swinging, certain events and environments open up additional Spider-powers for you to control. Using Spider-Man’s web abilities, he can catch falling objects including people and debris, fix hazards like broken train rails, barricade doors, and even slingshot from the tops of buildings for increased speed and huge air. Spider-Man is growing up – As players master Spider-Man’s powers through natural progression and completion of missions and challenges, Spider-Man gains ability enhancements including improved web moves, swing skills, and amazing melee combos.]]></description>

	<title><![CDATA[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]></title>
	<description><![CDATA[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is the quintessential role-playing game for the next generation and another leap forward in gaming. Step inside the most richly detailed and vibrant game-world ever created. With a powerful combination of freeform gameplay and unprecedented graphics, you can unravel the main quest at your own pace or explore the vast world and find your own challenges. Oblivion is a single-player game that takes place in Tamriel's capital province, Cyrodiil. You are given the task of finding the hidden heir to a throne that sits empty, the previous emperor having been killed by an unknown assassin. With no true Emperor, the gates to Oblivion (the equivalent of hell in the world of Tamriel) open, and demons begin to invade Cyrodiil and attack its people and towns. It's up to you to find the lost heir to the throne and unravel the sinister plot that threatens to destroy all of Tamriel. In keeping with the Elder Scrolls tradition, players will have the option to experience the main quest at their own pace, and there will be plenty of opportunities to explore the vast world and make your own way. Numerous factions can be joined, such as the thieves or mages guilds, and each contains its own complete storyline and the chance to rise to the head of the faction and reap further rewards. Oblivion features a groundbreaking new AI system, called Radiant AI, which gives non-player characters (NPCs) the ability to make their own choices based on the world around them. They'll decide where to eat or who to talk to and what they'll say. They'll sleep, go to church, and even steal items, all based on their individual characteristics. Full facial animations and lip-synching, combined with full speech for all dialog, allows NPCs to come to life like never before.]]></description>
