   MINT HILL

   Last fall, an assistant coach from East Carolina sat in the
   Independence High basketball office, chatting with 6-foot-10 center
   Justyn Hamilton. He told the 16-year-old junior he felt sorry for
   Patriots boys’ coach Preston Davis.

   “He’s like, ‘Coach Davis is not going to reap the benefits of you
   reaching your full potential,’ ” Davis recalled Friday night after an
   86-59 win against Myers Park. “I think he feels, like most college
   coaches do, that Justyn’s best days are going to be down the road.”

   Hamilton, a slender 185 pounds, is ranked No. 14 in the N.C. class of
   2017 by the Phenom Hoop Report, which tracks recruits statewide. He has
   scholarship offers from College of Charleston, East Tennessee State,
   High Point, North Florida, UNC Greensboro and Virginia Commonwealth.
   He’s received interest from East Carolina, Georgia, Syracuse, Temple
   and Virginia.

   This summer, when he’s playing on the Nike circuit with the
   Charlotte-based Team United travel program, coaches from those colleges
   promised they will watch him often to monitor his progress. The
   message, Davis believes, is that Hamilton, who turns 17 March 29, is on
   the cusp of becoming an elite national recruit. He believes his
   player’s size and rapidly developing skill set are the major reasons
   why.

   “If he gets the ball in the middle of a zone, he’ll kick it out to our
   shooters,” Davis said. “He can knock down shots. When teams press us, I
   have him come up and help our guards. If he gets the ball in the
   middle, he has the freedom to bring the ball up.”

   Earlier this season, Hamilton stole a pass near his basket that would
   have led to an East Mecklenburg layup. In the same sequence, he
   dribbled the length of the court and led the Patriots’ break. When he
   was close to the Eagles’ basket, he elevated and threw down a
   two-handed dunk over an Eagles player.

   “Those plays,” Davis said, “you hardly see from a 6-10 guy, and it
   shows the ability he has, and why a lot of high majors are interested.”

   As a sophomore, Hamilton averaged 2.9 points and 3.3 rebounds. Last
   summer, he was invited by USA Basketball to try out for a Junior
   National team after a strong summer with Team United. This season, he’s
   averaging 8.9 points, 7.5 rebounds and 4.1 blocks. In Friday’s win
   against Myers Park, he had nine points, 11 rebounds and six blocks.

   “He’s definitely much improved from last year,” Mustangs coach Wes
   Helper said. “One of his biggest assets is the way he protects the rim.
   It’s tough to score when you’ve got a 6-10 kid in there with a 7-foot
   wingspan.

   “With that type of size, you’re going to draw a lot of attention. The
   other thing that impressed me was that he caught balls in the middle of
   our zone and knocked down a couple of jump shots. It’s scary we’ll have
   to put up with him for one more year.”

   Hamilton said he learned a lot in Colorado playing with elite recruits
   like Jason Tatum, a Duke recruit ranked No. 2 nationally by ESPN, and
   Josh Jackson, the No. 3 recruit in the national rankings.

   “I learned to hustle and to work,” Hamilton said. “And after that
   (experience), the game slowed down for me. I realized I’m nowhere near
   close to where I need to be. There’s more work I can put in. It
   motivated me. It really did. My work ethic changed.

   “Every time I step on the court now, I push myself, even when I’m
   tired. I try to get every rebound, every block, and I’m a whole lot
   less lazy.”

   Coach Davis is pushing Hamilton to get stronger (Hamilton’s in the
   Patriots’ weight-training classes) and to be more aggressive. He said
   Hamilton is poised for a strong junior playoff push and what he calls
   “a spectacular senior season.”

   Davis said he knows the East Carolina coach is right: He’ll never see
   the best of Justyn Hamilton while at Independence.

   “He has a chance to have a really great career, depending on how he
   works,” Davis said. “It sounds crazy, but being 6-10 and having that
   skill set, you never know, but we could be looking at a true pro right
   now.

   “Think about a guy like (7-foot Gastonia native) Hassan Whitesides (of
   the Miami Heat). In high school, he was not much of the major player
   that he is now, and he continued to get better and better and better.
   Justyn has the potential to do that. I don’t know if he’ll get there. I
   hope he does, but I tell him all the time, it’s about how hard he
   works. It’s really up to him.”
