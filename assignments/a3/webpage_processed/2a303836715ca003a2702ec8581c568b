   Ah, Super Bowl Sunday: An ad extravaganza punctuated by brief forays
   into actual football. Since this year's game was kind of a dud, we were
   OK with that. As we did the last few years (you can find [93]2014 here,
   and [94]2015 here), we graded [95]the best and worst of this year's
   Super Bowl ads.

   [Related: [96]Mountain Dew's PuppyMonkeyBaby terrifies, delights
   viewers]

   As always, our criteria for judgment remain rigidly unscientific and
   completely biased. Looking for the popular opinion? Well, [97]USA
   Today's crowd-based Admeter rated  the top 5 Super Bowl commercials
   like this: [98]Kevin Hart's "First Date" Hyundai commercial, followed
   by [99]Heinz's Wiener Stampede, [100]Doritos' Ultrasound Baby,
   [101]Doritos' Doritos Dogs and[102] Hyundai's Ryanville.

   Our critiques were a bit different so without further delay here are
   our grades for Super Bowl 50's ads:

   Grade A

   [103]Avocados From Mexico: InSpace

   IFRAME:
   [104]http://screen.yahoo.com/big-game-ads/avocados-mexico-big-game-ad-2
   01411999.html?format=embed&player_autoplay=false

   Two years of Super Bowl commercials, two As for the super fruit from
   south of the border. This year‚Äôs clip capitalized by combining a number
   of successful ingredients: Star Wars-type aliens, nostalgia for the
   past, a glimpse into the future and mocking the career of Scott Baio.
   If Avocados From Mexico do it again for next year‚Äôs Super Bowl, it‚Äôll
   be considered a dynasty.

   [105]Mountain Dew: PuppyMonkeyBaby

   IFRAME:
   [106]http://screen.yahoo.com/big-game-ads/mountain-dew-big-game-ad-2002
   09812.html?format=embed&player_autoplay=false

   Did you see a PuppyMonkeyBaby running around in your nightmares last
   night? No? Go ahead and try a Mountain Dew Kickstart  ... How about
   now?

   [107]NFL: Super Bowl Babies
   OK, put aside the inherent creepiness involved in singing about your
   parents doin' it. This was brilliant, a collection of babies born nine
   months after the Super Bowl harmonizing with Seal. Key moment: the
   Seattle babies crying. Sadly, no Buffalo millennials. Nice work, NFL.
   This doesn't get you off the hook for concussions, but we'll let
   Coldplay slide for this.

   [108]Intuit: Death Wish Coffee

   IFRAME:
   [109]http://screen.yahoo.com/big-game-ads/intuit-big-game-ad-death-1950
   15994.html?format=embed&player_autoplay=false

   Fierce Vikings row and row through a storm. But there‚Äôs a twist! The
   ocean is a sea of coffee that quickly disappears down a man‚Äôs gullet.
   The New York-based small business, which boasts the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs strongest
   coffee‚Äù won the ad in a contest by Intuit. They [110]tell Daniel
   Roberts of Yahoo Finance they expect to sell millions of pounds after
   the spot. [111]Hope they upgraded their servers.

   [112]Audi: Commander
   Letting the ol' astronaut take the controls one last time: Touching.
   Comparing driving an Audi to commanding a moon shot: overreaching.
   Using the late David Bowie's song "Starman" to tie it all together:
   heartbreaking. We're grading this one on a curve.

   [113]MINI USA: Defy Labels
   In the year of the celebrity Super Bowl ad, it‚Äôs probably no surprise
   that the sports blog liked the one that was packed with sports
   celebrities. Serena Williams! Abby Wambach! Tony Hawk! Randy Johnson!
   Plus some cool guitar music and Harvey Keitel! Who wants to watch the
   Italian Job?

   [114]Acura NSX: What He Said
   Yeah, it looks like Acura‚Äôs ad agency just learned of the isolated
   David Lee Roth vocals that have been floating around the Internet for
   years. But that track is still awesome. As is Diamond Dave. As is this
   ad.

   [115]Pantene: Strong Is Beautiful
   Dads trying to do their daughters' hair. If you've got a daughter, you
   give this an A three seconds in. Even if you don't, you probably know
   someone's daughter. Always a great message.
   [116]Doritos: Ultrasound

   IFRAME:
   [117]http://screen.yahoo.com/big-game-ads/doritos-big-game-ad-ultrasoun
   d-001805251.html?format=embed&player_autoplay=false

   Yeah, sure, it‚Äôs yet another ad with a slobby dude and a shrewish wife.
   What makes this one so hysterically awful, or awfully hysterical, is
   the final image: of a baby in the womb so hungry for Doritos that it
   makes an early exit. Probably a lot less funny to any woman who‚Äôs had a
   difficult delivery. We can hear the OWWWWWs from a hundred thousand
   Super Bowl parties.
   [118]Pepsi: Joy of Pepsi

   IFRAME:
   [119]http://screen.yahoo.com/big-game-ads/pepsi-big-game-ad-janelle-025
   415811.html?format=embed&player_autoplay=false

   Confession: We love everything that Janelle Monae does. How long before
   she gets tabbed for a Super Bowl halftime show?
   Hyundai: First Date
   America is a society losing privacy at every turn, a land where we are
   watched 24/7 and our every movement tracked. This is a horrible
   invasion of our personal space ‚Ä¶ unless you‚Äôre a daughter and your dad
   is watching over you. Then it‚Äôs perfectly fine.

                                 __________

   Grade B

   [120]Apartments.com: Moving on Up

   IFRAME:
   [121]http://screen.yahoo.com/big-game-ads/apartments-com-big-game-ad-17
   3607703.html?format=embed&player_autoplay=false

   In one of the more technically brilliant ads of the night, Jeff
   Goldblum takes a crane ride up the side of a New York city apartment
   building while playing the theme from The Jeffersons. Some charged last
   week that L‚Äôil Wayne cooking for George Washington [122]was racist, but
   the rapper‚Äôs camp denied those charges to TMZ and said the appearance
   was only about fun. And getting people to rent apartments, presumably.
   [123]Amazon Echo

   IFRAME:
   [124]http://screen.yahoo.com/big-game-ads/amazon-echo-big-game-ad-03061
   3262.html?format=embed&player_autoplay=false

   Another of those ‚Äúthrow everyone we can find into an ad‚Äù ads, this one
   features Alec Baldwin and Dan Marino trash-talking each other as Missy
   Elliott and Jason Schwartzmann look on. Still not quite sure how Echo‚Äôs
   going to function, but that‚Äôs not the point here.

   [125]Budweiser: Simply Put

   IFRAME:
   [126]http://screen.yahoo.com/big-game-ads/budweiser-big-game-ad-simply-
   190010391.html?format=embed&player_autoplay=false

   Helen Mirren is simply delightful. And getting lectured to in a prim
   British voice makes you feel guilty even if you haven't done anything
   wrong. Sure, a fair percentage of people whom this ad is trying to
   reach will tune her out, but if even one person decides to hand over
   the keys because that lovely English lady said so, then hey, we have a
   successful ad.

   [127]Campbell‚Äôs: This One‚Äôs For Mom
   We knew we were being manipulated, but the love and support of the
   mother in the commercial left us feeling as warm as a bowl of
   Campbell‚Äôs Chunky Hearty Cheeseburger soup.

   [128]Colgate: Every Drop Counts
   The toothpaste titan used its 30 seconds to remind those of us with
   access to clean water to turn off the faucet while we brush. We admire
   their effort to spread a message of conservation and for resisting the
   urge to shame us for also forgetting to floss.

   [129]Wix.com: Po discovers power of Wix.com
   We had never heard of website builder Wix.com or even knew what it did
   before this ad. Now we do, thanks to the characters from Kung Fu Panda
   3. Maybe the most effective ad of the night.
   [130]Prius: Getaway Car

   IFRAME:
   [131]http://screen.yahoo.com/toyota-big-game-ad-prius-015206984.html?fo
   rmat=embed&player_autoplay=false

   Surely someone somewhere is going to complain that Prius is advocating
   illegality and bank robbery with this particular ad. We look forward to
   the first bank robbers caught using this car who claim they were
   inspired by the ad. The Prius Defense will set new legal precedent.
   (Bonus: having the Sobotka family from The Wire pull off the heist was
   inspired casting.)
   [132]WeatherTech: Made In America
   Going straight for the heart there with the patriotism angle, eh,
   WeatherTech? Smart move. Nobody‚Äôs going to pay much attention to a
   truck bed liner commercial on its own, but wrap it in the flag? Boom,
   attention and love.
   [133]Don‚Äôt Struggle With OIC
   Constipation ad as black-and-white art film. Another one of those ads
   with a surprisingly narrow focus for the Super Bowl, but hey, if it
   works ...
   [134]Dollar Shave Club
   Clever little ad from Dollar Shave Club, which might have to go to Five
   Dollar Shave Club after paying for this ad. Try not to think about what
   exactly is caught on the blades of that filthy razor.

                                  _________

   Grade C

   [135]Shock Top (Anheuser-Busch): Unfiltered Talk

   IFRAME:
   [136]http://screen.yahoo.com/big-game-ads/shock-top-big-game-ad-1752216
   58.html?format=embed&player_autoplay=false

   Loved the idea of beer tapper as insult comic ‚Äî it‚Äôd make solo trips to
   the bar a lot less lonely ‚Äî but most of the jokes ended up like a
   weeks-old barrel. Flat.

   (By the way, anyone else notice the tap handles of InBev‚Äôs other craft
   beers lurking in the back? Made us wonder what the goose has to say.)

   [137]SunTrust: Hold Your Breath
   This grade is not for the concept behind the ad; getting one's
   financial house in order is a worthy endeavor. It's for the execution:
   nobody wants to think about their credit rating or single-digit savings
   account when they're trying to enjoy the game.

   [138]Pokemon: Train On

   IFRAME:
   [139]http://screen.yahoo.com/big-game-ads/pokemon-big-game-ad-train-195
   015818.html?format=embed&player_autoplay=false

   Prediction: Once the NFL collapses from its own mass, our excuse to get
   together in the winter over a plate of chili cheese dip will be the big
   Pokemon battle they showed at the end of this ad. Over 80 percent of
   the population will fail to notice a difference.
   [140]Kia: Christopher Walken (extended)
   The opening pun was chuckle-worthy ‚Äî ‚ÄúWalken‚Äù closet, get it? ‚Äî but it
   went downhill from there as the inestimable actor spent his time
   likening a Kia automobile to a pair of colorful socks. Needed more
   cowbell.

   [141]Sofi: Loans for Great People
   Fairly straightforward financial-products advertisement set amongst
   beautiful young urban hipsters that make up 95 percent of the country,
   in the eyes of creative agencies. Best part is that everyone is going
   to look around their Super Bowl party and assess whether everyone else
   is ‚Äúgreat‚Äù or not. (You are, of course.)

   [142]Bud Light: The Bud Light Party
   Fun party game: see how many subversive references are going to provoke
   outraged Letters (not emails, letters) to the Editor. Start with the
   not-too-big caucus and go from there.

   [143]Marmot: Snow Angel (teaser) What the heck is Marmot? A new movie
   character? A delicious new dish from some fast-food chain? A new drug
   that will cure your ills while possibly causing organ detonation? Who
   knows?
   [144]Michelob: Breathing
   You thought this was going to be something like Nike, didn't you? Some
   kind of workout product? So when Michelob Ultra came up, you're
   thinking, "really?" Cool enough setup, bit of a letdown.
   [145]Hyundai: Ryanville
   Women in Hyundai do a good job of masking their disappointment that
   Ryan Reynolds and not Ryan Gosling was cast in this ad.
   [146]Skittles: Steven Tyler
   Sure, this is some high-level strangeness, but it‚Äôs Skittles and it‚Äôs
   Steven Tyler, so you gotta figure they just multiply one another. Of
   course, it‚Äôs entirely possible that Steven Tyler thought that Skittles
   portrait was a mirror.
   Honda
   Our bias against talking animals is deep and well-earned after decades
   of contrived wackiness. But when you throw in sheep lip-sync‚Äôing to
   Queen, well, that gets you out of the F territory. Not sure what it has
   to do with a truck, but whatever.

                                 __________

   Grade: D

   [147]Bud Light: Teaser (Amy Schumer and Seth Rogen)
   Maybe one day we‚Äôll learn why the Illuminati continues to push Amy and
   Seth on us despite the fact that neither are particularly funny. But
   Sunday was not that day.

   [148]Quicken: What Were We Thinking?
   Push Button. Get Mortgage. Come to think of it, that‚Äôs a pretty great
   title for the inevitable sequel to ‚ÄúThe Big Short.‚Äù

   [149]Snickers: Marilyn
   Hey! Yanking a star from beyond the grave to hawk merch! That's never
   been done before! Points for using Willem Dafoe, though. That dude
   makes everything better ... even if we'll be seeing him in that skirt
   in our nightmares. (For more along those lines, see [150]his take on
   the infamous Marilyn Monroe "Happy Birthday" song.)

   [151]LG: Man From the Future
   To the people who got Liam Neeson to do this commercial but had him
   stop short of saying ‚ÄúI will find you and I will kill you: We will find
   you and ... we‚Äôll hit fast forward on our DVRs next time.

   [152]T-Mobile: Restricted Bling
   You can see exactly how the ad agency came up with this one: "Hey,
   guess what! You know that Drake fellow all the kids like, with that
   funny video where he dances so badly? He mentions cell phones! Let's
   glom right on that action!"

   [153]AXE: Find Your Magic

   IFRAME:
   [154]http://screen.yahoo.com/big-game-ads/axe-big-game-ad-magic-1752211
   69.html?format=embed&player_autoplay=false

   Inspiration from the product that prevents perspiration. We gotta sweat
   this one, though: This ad felt like the type you‚Äôd see in a movie
   theatre before the next Marvel flick and not in the highest-profile ad
   showcase of the year.

   [155]Jack In The Box: Declaration of Delicious
   The "we stunk before, but we're good now! Promise!" gambit is always a
   risky one to take. Good luck with that, JitB. Also, don't know about
   you, but if some hydrocephalic Colonial dude comes out of the water
   handing me a burger, pretty much the last thing I'm going to do is eat
   it.
   [156]Paypal
   This wasn't a really memorable ad, but it does raise the question: Did
   Paypal "paypal" CBS $4.5 million for the ad?
   [157]Taco Bell: Quesalupa
   Taco Bell promises that the quesalupa, whatever that is, will be bigger
   than anything in history. Yeah, ok. You can only combine different
   names of Mexican food in so many ways, Taco Bell. We look forward to
   the Chadillaita next year.
   [158]Coca-Cola: Little Marvels

   IFRAME:
   [159]http://screen.yahoo.com/big-game-ads/coca-cola-big-game-ad-0128137
   81.html?format=embed&player_autoplay=false

   Oh, this could have been so good. Getting licensed to use both Ant-Man
   and the Hulk? (Though clearly not with Paul Rudd‚Äôs voice.) But the ad
   is surprisingly bland, a by-the-numbers opposites-work-together Super
   Bowl ad. Where‚Äôs Thanos when you need him?

                                 __________

   Grade F

   [160]Heinz: Meet the Ketchups

   Yes, the stampede of wiener dogs dressed as hot dogs was well executed.
   But we have to side with our Chicago pals ‚ÄúSuperdawg‚Äù [162]in their
   fight with the condiment titan this week. Ketchup doesn‚Äôt belong
   anywhere near a hot dog.

   [163]Doritos: Doritos Dogs

   [164]http://screen.yahoo.com/big-game-ads/doritos-big-game-ad-doritos-1

   A pack of hounds stake out a grocery store in search of delicious corn
   chips, finally break through with the old cartoon standby of standing
   on each others shoulders to dress as a human. If you‚Äôve seen it once,
   you‚Äôve seen it a thousand times. RIP Creativity. It was a good run.

   This one was cute enough but absolutely cratered once the bears started
   talking. (Vegan! Cheat days! So wacky!) These bears are the ursine
   equivalent of the annoying dude by the salsa dip who just will NOT shut
   up about that time he saw Peyton Manning in the grocery store. Less
   talking, more campsite-pillaging, bears.
