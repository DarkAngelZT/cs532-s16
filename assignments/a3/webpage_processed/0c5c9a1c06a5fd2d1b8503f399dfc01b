   SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- [121]Carolina Panthers quarterback [122]Cam
   Newton didn't get to dab during Super Bowl 50, and he didn't feel like
   talking after his team's [123]24-10 loss to the [124]Denver Broncos.

   The newly crowned league MVP walked out on reporters Sunday after
   answering only a handful of questions, mostly with short, soft-spoken
   answers.

    [128]Transcript of Cam Newton's postgame comments
       Cam Newton was visibly upset when talking to the media after the
       Super Bowl. Here's what he said.
     * [129]Mistake-prone Panthers flub Super Bowl
       The team that dabbed flubbed. The Panthers committed four turnovers
       and 12 penalties, missed a field goal attempt and couldn't keep the
       Broncos' ferocious pass rush away from Cam Newton in a Super Bowl
       50 loss.

   The disappointment on Newton's face was as noticeable as the lack of
   flair in his postgame attire. Throughout the season Newton wore
   designer suits and sport coats, often with sequin-studded loafers,
   following games. On this night he wore a black hoodie with the hood
   pulled over his head.

   Newton appeared downcast and spoke few words as he peered from
   underneath the hoodie while the voices of Broncos players talking
   exuberantly about the victory reverberated from the adjacent interview
   area. The moment was reminiscent of the first two years of Newton's
   career, when he was criticized for wearing a towel over his head on the
   sideline and sulking during losses.

   Asked to put his disappointment into words, Newton delivered his
   longest answer.

   "They just played better than us," he said. "I don't know what you want
   me to say. They made more plays than us, and that's what it came down
   to. We had opportunities. There wasn't nothing special that they did.
   We dropped balls, we turned the ball over, gave up sacks, threw errant
   passes. That's it. They scored more points than us."
   [r51661_576x324_16-9.jpg&w=130&h=130&scale=crop&location=center] League
   MVP Cam Newton could not break free of a suffocating Broncos front to
   keep the Panthers from falling behind in Super Bowl 50. Ed
   Szczepanski/USA TODAY Sports

   Newton had nothing to be excited about after Super Bowl 50. He had one
   interception and two fumbles, one of which resulted in a first-quarter
   touchdown by Denver's defense. He was sacked six times for minus-64
   yards. He completed 18 of 41 pass attempts for 265 yards and a
   season-worst 55.4 passer rating.

   Asked whether Denver did anything different defensively than he had
   seen on film, Newton said, "Nothing different."

   Asked why the Panthers didn't play like they have all season, when they
   led the league in scoring (31.2 PPG), he said. "They outplayed us."

   Asked if he could put his disappointment into words, he said, "We
   lost."

   Asked what coach Ron Rivera told players in the locker room, he said,
   "He told us a lot of things."

   All this came after Newton's mother, Jackie, sent her son a heartfelt
   text message, which the Pro Bowl quarterback posted on Instagram before
   the game.

   In the message, Jackie wrote: "I understand that hot and cold water
   comes out of different fountains. You are neither hot or cold. You have
   a big platform. Which fountain are you? Don't let the devil win over
   your words or speech that represents the dark world. But represent the
   awesome God you serve through your words. ... You win with your
   character and powerful words you speak.''

   After the game, wide receiver [130]Jerricho Cotchery tried to put into
   words how his quarterback felt.

   "He's just hurting, man," said Cotchery, who dropped two passes Sunday
   after having none all season. "He put in a lot of work ... had a heck
   of a year."

   Cotchery declined to speculate on whether Newton's postgame behavior
   would evoke past criticisms.

   "We all have areas where we can grow," he said. "He has a family and
   friends that will talk to him and say to him whatever they need to say
   to him."

   Broncos defensive back Chris Harris, [131]whose voice could be heard
   during Newton's news conference, said in an interview with NFL Live
   that will air at 3 p.m. ET: "I have no idea why they had us in the same
   room or anywhere close to us, so I would have been mad, too, if I was
   Cam. ... To be able to hear your opponent right behind you talking,
   nobody wants to hear that.

   "I think that was a bad setup, but things happen," Harris said. "But
   you gotta deal with it and approach things like a man. We've been in
   that situation where we lost a Super Bowl. ... I'm just happy we were
   on the good side of things this time."

   Rivera said he spoke briefly to Newton after the game.

   "This is one of those things that's going to hurt," Rivera said. "It's
   going to hurt everybody for a while. Hopefully, after a few days or
   whatever it is, we're going to get over it, and we'll move forward."

   Newton's most poignant moment, other than abruptly walking away, came
   when he was asked whether he had a message for Carolina supporters.

   "We'll be back," he said.

   Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James was asked Monday morning about
   Newton's news conference. James said he didn't see it, but he added, "I
   know it's very difficult to play in one of the biggest games of your
   life and come out on the wrong side of it and then have to
   automatically answer questions. And we also know as professionals
   that's part of the business.

   "We also know that you guys are part of the reason that help the game
   be as great as it is, so you gotta, as difficult as it is to answer
   some of the questions that you know this is the last thing you want to
   talk about, you have to go up there and take the onus, and take the
   good with the bad. Like I said, I didn't see the Cam interview, but I
   can only imagine what happened. But I've been in that situation before
   on both sides, so it's difficult."
