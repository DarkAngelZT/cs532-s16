   During Super Bowl 50 on CBS, 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros. and Marvel
   Studios all offered up new previews for their imminent slate of comic
   book movies.

   Next up on the comic book movie release schedule are [49]Deadpool,
   [50]Batman v. Superman, [51]Captain America: Civil War, and [52]X-Men:
   Apocalypse. Each of these films were previewed during the big game and
   on top of that, a Marvel & Coca-Cola ad showed cinematic versions
   Ant-Man and the Hulk battling over a can of Coke. Though, not included
   in the super cut below, you can [53]watch it [54]right here.

   Deadpool hits theaters February 12, followed by Batman v. Superman:
   Dawn of Justice on March 25, Captain America: Civil War on May 5, and
   X-Men: Apocalypse on May 26.

       Lol. Those tv spots for BvS just weren't that good- they were very
       boring and not exciting. If anything, it was just a marketing ploy
       for Turkish Airlines. At least Marvel and Coke were able to create
       a really awesome and fun tv spot.

       The coke ad was also a marketing ploy.
