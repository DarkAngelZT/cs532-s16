       Snapshot_20160207_221557 NFL Network
       The Denver Broncos stunned the NFL world, beating the Carolina
       Panthers handily in the Super Bowl 24-10, in a game that the
       Broncos seemingly dominated from beginning to end.
       Needless to say, Cam Newton was not happy during his post-game
       press conference. But how unhappy he was, was a bit jarring.
       After ignoring several questions and barely answering serveral
       others, Newton abruptly ended his session with the media by getting
       up and walking out.

       Hall of Famer Deion Sanders of the NFL Network had a strong
       reaction after seeing this, saying, "I understand you are upset,
       but you cannot do that."
       Here are the final 2+ minutes of the press conference, sped up,
       where Cam just looks completely dejected and that he would rather
       be anywhere else.

       It is understandable that Cam is not happy, but this is not a good
       look for the new face of the NFL. As Marshall Faulk of the NFL
       Network noted moments later, Newton will learn and will handle this
       better in the future.
