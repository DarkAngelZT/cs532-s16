   Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers fans were glued to their
   television screens and living and dying on every snap during Super Bowl
   Sunday, but the actual football took a backseat for many other
   spectators.

   After all, Sunday was also the Super Bowl of commercials, and there
   were plenty of advertisements that will have people talking around the
   water cooler Monday. Peyton Manning and the Broncos may be champions of
   the NFL, but the companies who broadcast their commercials to millions
   of football fans watching Sunday also made a mark.

   What's more, they will be replayed in viral fashion online for weeks to
   come.

   Here is a look at some of the most memorable ads and movie trailers
   throughout Sunday's Super Bowl.


First Quarter

   Comedian Kevin Hart graced television screens as the star of the first
   commercial after the coin toss.

   He played an overprotective father who allowed his daughter and her
   date to borrow his Hyundai. While he humorously tracked their
   whereabouts, track star Lolo Jones didn't buy the premise:

     That's def not Kevin's car
     — Lolo Jones (@lolojones) [31]February 7, 2016

   Freddie Coleman of ESPN Radio wasn't intimidated by the 5'4" Hart:

     If Kevin Hart was your date's dad, how afraid would you NOT be?
     — Freddie Coleman (@ColemanESPN) [32]February 7, 2016

   Those looking for a classic Budweiser advertisement as the first
   commercial after kickoff were surprised with a
   fitness-centric [33]Michelob Ultra spot. Matt Brown of SB Nation
   reacted:

     wow this fitness commercial is really going to motivate me to get
     out and do some running again
     <eats another chicken wing>
     — Matt Brown (@MattSBN) [34]February 7, 2016

   Snickers gave fans an interesting visual image when Willem Dafoe
   portrayed a hungry Marilyn Monroe:

     Marilyn Monroe doesn’t feel quite like herself when she’s hungry.

   [39]Apartments.com brought rapper Lil Wayne together with George
   Washington and Jeff Goldblum in one of the more unexpected groupings
   football fans saw Sunday. 247Sports responded appropriately:

     Lil Wayne in an [40]https://t.co/LrROdEIorY commercial kicking field
     goals
     ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ [41]#SB50 | [42]#CARvsDEN
     — 247Sports (@247Sports) [43]February 7, 2016

   Goldblum wasn't the only movie star to appear in a first-quarter
   advertisement. Arnold Schwarzenegger went the mobile route:

     Now [44]@MobileStrike has everyone reaching for their phones! Head
     to the App Store now--> [45]https://t.co/SgxAuPbLg8
     [46]#SB50[47]https://t.co/GHznepCkJa
     — Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) [48]February 7, 2016

   Doritos and the NFL both incorporated babies in their advertisements.
   Doritos showed a baby on an ultrasound machine chasing a chip and
   earned Bleacher Report's praise:

     — Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) [52]February 8, 2016

   Ad Age wondered about the NFL's assertion that more babies are born in
   nine months inside the cities of Super Bowl winners:

     data… [54]#SuperBowlads
     — Ad Age (@adage) [55]February 7, 2016

   Odell Beckham Jr. made an appearance at a wedding in a Buick commercial
   when a guest made a falling-back, one-handed catch like the New York
   Giants receiver.

   Zach Braziller of the New York Post probably didn't thrill many Giants
   fans with his take on the spot:

Second Quarter

   The second-quarter commercials added some star power.

   Seth Rogen and Amy Schumer were politician-like for the Bud Light Party
   and pointed out a number of things all Americans can agree about headed
   into an election. Bud Light shared the advertisement:

     FIRST LOOK: Check out our [64]#SuperBowl commercial and support the
     [65]#BudLightParty! [66]https://t.co/PPrFReS3b2
     — Bud Light (@budlight) [67]February 3, 2016

   One of the talking points for Rogen and Schumer was the country's love
   for Paul Rudd. Reese Witherspoon agreed:

     .[68]@amyschumer "everybody loves Paul Rudd" [69]#sotrue
     [70]#lovethatguy [71]#SB50
     — Reese Witherspoon (@RWitherspoon) [72]February 8, 2016

   Rudd's character, Ant-Man, joined the Hulk in a [73]battle for a
   Coca-Cola can. Eventually, Ant-Man helped the Hulk open the small can,
   and he weighed in on his decision-making process:

     I like to think of it more as "teamwork."
     [74]https://t.co/L9JWeFtE41
     — Ant-Man (@AntMan) [75]February 8, 2016

   While the Marvel characters were trying to open sugary soft drinks,
   Steven Tyler had a bit of a sweet tooth as well in a Skittles spot.

   Skittles gave fans the chance to win the singing portrait:

     Proceeds go to [80]@JaniesFund [81]https://t.co/wWdn18wIee.

     — Skittles (@Skittles) [83]February 8, 2016

   T-Mobile also used a celebrity when Steve Harvey harkened back to his
   Miss Universe hosting job and realized he wasn't the only one to make a
   mistake:

     It takes balls to admit you’re wrong—so we called in
     [84]@IAmSteveHarvey to school [85]@Verizon.
     [86]#BALLOGIZE[87]https://t.co/O22DMaF1p1
     — T-Mobile (@TMobile) [88]February 8, 2016

   Will Carr of Fox News approved of Harvey's strategy:

     Got to give it to Steve Harvey for making money off that. Laughing
     all the way to the bank [89]#SB50
     — Will Carr (@WillCarrFNC) [90]February 8, 2016

   [91]Prius had a lengthy commercial near the end of the second quarter,
   but Hayley Byrnes (the digital host for the Utah Jazz) was looking for
   one man in particular:

     Only person who can make a Prius cool.

     — Hayley Byrnes (@HayleyByrnes) [93]February 8, 2016


Third Quarter

   Doritos made another comeback in the third quarter with a commercial
   that featured dogs consistently attempting to sneak into a store and
   get their paws on the chips.

   Chris B. Brown of Smart Football was a fan of the ad:

     I'm down with the Doritos/dogs in disguise commercial
     — Chris B. Brown (@smartfootball) [97]February 8, 2016

   Serena Williams, Abby Wambach and other celebrities defied labels for
   Mini Cooper:

     We’re perpetually inspired by those who have had the courage to
     challenge stereotypes and
     [98]#DefyLabels.[99]https://t.co/G8lMDalh1i
     — MINI USA (@MINIUSA) [100]February 1, 2016

   While the Mini Cooper spot was loaded with celebrities, Turbo Tax
   landed former Oscar winner and widely respected actor Anthony Hopkins,
   who claimed he wasn't selling out by being in a commercial, because
   Turbo Tax is free.

   Matt Spiegel of 670 The Score in Chicago enjoyed the play on words:

     Anthony Hopkins refusing to sell out made me laugh. As did the dog's
     name.
     — Matt Spiegel (@MattSpiegel670) [104]February 8, 2016

   The third quarter also disturbed some fans, including attorney Kevin
   Hayslett:

   Those who voted for Death Wish coffee in the QuickBooks’ Small Business
   Big Game [108]Competition reaped their rewards in the third quarter:

     WE WON! RT if you voted! Watch it here: [109]https://t.co/8gkXQZD973

   [112]Butterfinger asked consumers to be bold as it showed someone
   leaping out of a plane riding a bull, and Doritos recognized the
   strategy:

     .[113]@Butterfinger They say imitation is the sincerest form of
     flattery [114]#FORTHEBOLD [115]#Doritos [116]#SB50
     — Doritos (@Doritos) [117]February 8, 2016

   The Heinz Ketchup family also had the opportunity to share its love, as
   USA Today shared:

     In the [118]@HeinzKetchup_US [119]#SB50 ad, the dog who makes the
     leap into Ketchup’s arms is named Archie.

Fourth Quarter

   The fourth quarter started with an expanded Super Bowl babies bit that
   showed children singing in a number of victorious cities throughout
   history, including Green Bay, San Francisco, New York and Seattle.

   Bill Landis of Cleveland.com joked at the City of Brotherly Love's
   expense:

     According to that Super Bowl babies commercial, Philadelphia should
     have fewer people
     — Bill Landis (@BillLandis25) [126]February 8, 2016

   Fans got a look at what NFL legends and broadcasters Deion Sanders,
   Phil Simms and Howie Long have been doing when they aren't on camera,
   and they were lounging out in a [127]Jublia commercial, fighting
   toenail fungus. Sanders apparently forgot to tell someone he was in a
   Super Bowl ad:

     [128]@DeionSanders you didn't tell me you was in a commercial
     — Deion Sanders Jr (@DeionSandersJr) [129]February 8, 2016

   Christopher Walken lent his classic cadence to Kia in a spot comparing
   the car to socks:

     A little advice about socks, sedans, and not being devoured from
     Christopher Walken. [130]#AddPizzazz
     [131]#KiaOptima[132]https://t.co/2GLARdb3mC
     — Kia Motors America (@Kia) [133]February 5, 2016

   T-Mobile, which already featured Harvey in an earlier bit, riffed on
   Drake's song "Hotline Bling":

     [136]#YouGotCarriered [137]https://t.co/ebrSFafLUe

   Mike Prada of SB Nation supported T-Mobile's efforts:

     — Mike Prada (@MikePradaSBN) [139]February 8, 2016

   With the game drawing to a close, Helen Mirren urged spectators not to
   drink and drive like only she could. Budweiser shared the message:

     Telling your friends not to drive drunk can be awkward. Let Helen
     Mirren do it for you. [140]#GiveADamn and make a
     plan.[141]https://t.co/oqqCO20uW8

Movie Trailers

   The Super Bowl is also a hot spot for movie trailers, and Sunday's
   commercial breaks featured a number of them.

   Fans got nostalgic with trailers for new [143]Teenage Mutant Ninja
   Turtles and [144]Independence Day movies, and Jason Bourne kept the
   theme of sequels rolling:

     Here’s your first look at [145]@jasonbourne, in theaters this July.
     [146]#Bourne[147]https://t.co/xmlFT0bjjC
     — #Bourne (@jasonbourne) [148]February 8, 2016

   The Jungle Book also brought back an old classic:

     RT this new trailer for [149]@TheJungleBook to receive a special
     message from director [150]#JonFavreau!
     🐻🐯🐵🐍[151]https://t.co/aR1Ymg2oRK
     — The Jungle Book (@TheJungleBook) [152]February 7, 2016

   Hopefully football fans didn't get their fill of revamped franchises,
   because there was also a trailer for a new X-Men movie:

     Watch the new [153]#XMen: [154]#Apocalypse [155]#SB50 Commercial
     now. In theaters May 27.[156]https://t.co/xK6D59XaOi
     — X-Men Movies (@XMenMovies) [157]February 8, 2016

   It wasn't just sequels that stole the spotlight Sunday. The Secret Life
   of Pets sneaked its trailer in during the fourth quarter:

     Check out the new video [158]#TheSecretLifeofPets featured in
     today’s big game.[159]https://t.co/9A0PpTxLPO
     — #TheSecretLifeOfPets (@PetsMovie) [160]February 8, 2016

   While a number of companies stole headlines Sunday with humorous,
   entertaining and celebrity-filled advertisements, Manning and the
   Broncos emerged with a Super Bowl title and will likely head to Disney
   World in traditional fashion.

   That in and of itself is a commercial for the Happiest Place on Earth.
