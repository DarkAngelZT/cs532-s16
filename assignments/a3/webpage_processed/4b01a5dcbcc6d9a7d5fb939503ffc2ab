Why You’re Not Losing The Body Fat You Want

   This past week I had a breakthrough moment with a client. For those of
   you who have never worked with a personal trainer, these are the
   moments that make it all worth it. The moments that the client (you)
   gets slapped across the head with a realization so powerful that you’re
   forced to make a change. My client, let’s call her Sue, finally
   realized that simply adding in exercise to her long list of daily tasks
   was not going to solely make her lose the weight she wanted. As she
   finally understood this point, which I had been banging her upside her
   head for months, I also realized something. We American’s are so wired
   to go, go, go. That we forget the details. I find myself at fault of
   this as well. We think that if we just add in exercise to our week it
   will make all the difference, however, there is so much more change
   needed to see success. So, if you are someone who is exercising three
   times or more in a week and are still not seeing the results that you
   want, this post is for you. So keep on reading and lets jump start your
   fat loss!

   So you’re not seeing a loss of body fat as you progress in your
   exercise program? Let’s figure out why.

   5 Reasons why you’re not seeing results:
     * You are not eating real food

   I have yet to meet someone who is not “eating healthy”. When starting
   with a new client, who has been working out for awhile, the first
   question I ask is: What does your daily eating look like? The typical
   response that I get is: “Oh it’s actually pretty healthy, I never go
   over my recommended calories!” Unfortunately, our standard of eating
   healthy usually revolves around calories. If we are low in calories
   then we assume that we are doing good. Throw that idea out of the
   window and never let it come back to you. It is not about calories, it
   is about what you are putting into your body. Now, I’m not saying to go
   out there and stuff your face. I am saying to start focusing on the
   types of foods that you are eating and if they are real and nutritious.
     * You are not drinking enough water

   If you can’t honestly answer how many cups of water you have had by the
   end of the day then you are most likely not drinking enough.  According
   to a study by the Centers for [25]Disease
   http://images.intellitxt.com/ast/adTypes/icon1.png  Control and
   Prevention. Forty-three percent of adults drink less than four cups of
   water a day. That includes 36 percent who drink one to three cups, and
   7 percent who drink none. Chances are, if you are not experiencing a
   change in your body during your exercise program, you are one of these
   adults. With that being said, drink up and always know what cup you are
   on! Aim to have 12 cups of water a day. It may seem like a lot, but it
   is possible and will jump start your metabolisms fat burning power!
     * You are not eating enough

   No, that was not a typo that you just read. More times than often one
   of the problems that my clients face is a lack of food. If your morning
   consists of a granola bar and coffee, followed by a lunch that consists
   of a sandwich, and a dinner that is rarely seen. Then you my friend
   are undereating. You also fall into the category of not
   eating real food. Focus on eating 5 small meals a day. A balanced
   breakfast, lunch, and dinner with two HEALTHY snacks during the day.
     * You are avoiding resistance training like it’s the plague.

   The myth that resistance training is for “body builders”, “athletes”,
   or people trying to “get big” has finally been put in the ground. So
   let’s finish the job of burying it here.   New research published in
   the [26]Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition found
   that a diet high in protein paired with heavy resistance training
   equated to greater body fat loss. If you are still pounding out hours
   on the elliptical or treadmill during the week in order to “burn body
   fat” it is time that you changed your approach and safely start a
   resistance training program.
     * You are not sleeping

   It is time for a hard truth. Exercise is a stressor to the body. If you
   are not recovering from your exercise routine, you may be doing more
   harm than good. One sure way to make sure your body recovers is
   to simply sleep it off. If you are not achieving 7 or more hours of
   sleep a night, it is time for a schedule change. If you are like most
   of my clients then you work a long stressful job and have children to
   take care of. It may seem like there is not enough time in the day to
   get 7 hours of sleep, however, if you sit down and plan out the day,
   you will find that there is enough time. Make it happen!

   Take away message

   Spend the next 5 weeks focusing on these 5 areas of your life and you
   will see a change in body fat. Follow this simple check list to get
   started!

   Week 1- Make a grocery list of foods that are natural and eat
   them! Don’t worry about calories, just focus on getting a balance of
   fresh meat, organic vegetables, and good sources of fat, such as nuts
   and seeds.

   Week 2- Log your water intake. Keep track of the number of cups of
   water you consume during the day. Focus on increasing this number as
   the week progresses. Also, cut out sodas and alcoholic beverages to see
   a greater improvement in your metabolism.

   Week 3- Eat more of the good stuff. Now that you have established a
   great grocery list, map out 5 small meals that you will eat every day
   throughout the week. Switch it up and keep it as nutritious as
   possible.

   Week 4- add in resistance training. Add total body resistance exercises
   to your routine. Start by adding in two days this week. Remember before
   you start any resistance training program it is advised to consult a
   professional and learn proper technique.

   Week 5- Rest– Use this week to rest from all of your hard work. Focus
   on hitting 7 plus hours of sleep every night.
