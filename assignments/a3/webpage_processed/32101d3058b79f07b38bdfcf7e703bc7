History[[37]edit]

   RIT was a long-time member of the [38]Empire 8, an [39]NCAA
   [40]Division III athletic conference, but moved to the [41]Liberty
   League beginning with the 2011–2012 academic year. All of RIT's teams
   compete at the Division III level, with the exception of the [42]men's
   and [43]women's ice hockey programs, which play at the Division I
   level. In 2010, the men's ice hockey team was the first ever from the
   [44]Atlantic Hockey conference to reach the NCAA tournament
   semi-finals: The [45]Frozen Four.^[46][2]

   On March 17, 2012, the [47]Women's ice hockey team, after finishing the
   regular season with a record of 28-1-1, won its first NCAA Division III
   national championship, defeating the defending champion [48]Norwich
   University 4-1. The women's team had carried a record of 54-3-3 over
   their past 2 regular seasons leading up to that point.^[49][3] Three
   days later, RIT successfully applied for the women's hockey team to
   move from Division III to Division I. Starting in the 2012-2013 season,
   the women's team will be part of the [50]College Hockey America
   conference, and will be eligible for conference postseason play, but
   not NCAA postseason play. The moratorium on the NCAA postseason will be
   lifted beginning with the 2014-2015 season.^[51][4]

   Additionally, RIT has a wide variety of club, intramural, and pick-up
   sports and teams to provide a less-competitive recreational option to
   students.

   [52]Tom Coughlin, coach of the NFL's 2008 and 2012 Super Bowl champion
   [53]New York Giants, taught physical education and coached the RIT
   Men's Varsity Football team in the 1970s.

   Since 1968 the school's hockey teams played at [54]Frank Ritter
   Memorial Ice Arena on campus but in 2010, the school launched the
   "Power Play" campaign, in which it hoped to raise 15 of the 30 million
   dollars it would cost to build a new arena.^[55][5] On November 11,
   2011 it was announced that B. Thomas Golisano and the Polisseni
   Foundation were donating 4.5 million to the new arena, which came to be
   named the [56]Gene Polisseni Center.^[57][6] The new 4,300 seat arena
   was completed in 2014 and the Men's and Women's teams moved into the
   new facility in September for the 2014-2015 season.

Mascot[[58]edit]

   RIT's athletics nickname is the "Tigers", a name given following the
   undefeated men's basketball season of 1955-56. Prior to that, RIT's
   athletic teams were called the "Techmen" and had blue and silver as the
   sports colors. In 1963, RIT purchased a rescued [59]Bengal tiger which
   became the Institute's mascot, named SPIRIT. He was taken to sports
   events until 1964, when he was put down due to health
   complications.^[60][7] The original tiger's pelt now resides in the
   school's archives at the on-campus library. RIT helped the [61]Seneca
   Park Zoo purchase a new tiger shortly after SPIRIT's death, but it was
   not used as a school mascot. A metal sculpture in the center of the
   Henrietta campus now provides an everlasting version of the mascot.

   RIT's team mascot is a version of this Bengal Tiger named RITchie.
   RITchie was the selected name entered in 1989 by alumnus Richard P.
   Mislan ^[62][8] during a College Activities Board "Name the RIT Tiger"
   contest. After it was announced that the RIT Men's Hockey Team was
   moving from Division III to Division I in 2005, RITchie was redesigned
   and made his debut in the fall of 2006.
