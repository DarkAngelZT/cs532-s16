10 big-game fails that kicked off winning memes (pictures)

   Standout Super Bowl moments from Left Shark to botched national anthem
   lyrics have inspired the Internet to make some of its most iconic
   memes. We're talking about you, Richard Sherman.

The Left Shark

   If you don't have a team to root for, or even a reason to like
   football, going to Super Bowl parties can be as miserable as being a
   Cleveland Browns fan. Thankfully, the Internet usually jumps into the
   fray to pull out a gem or two as meme fodder. Here's a look back at
   some of the most memorable.

   Last year, singer Katy Perry's ridiculously entertaining Super Bowl
   halftime show created several popular memes, but none was more famous
   than her cartilaginous backup dancer, who [118]got most of the
   attention because he seemed to be doing his own thing.

Seahawks lose Super Bowl, but Left Shark wins the Internet

Katy Perry's lion, er, tiger...No wait, lion.

   The other animal at Katy Perry's halftime show that gained unexpected
   attention was considerably bigger than Left Shark. It also looked like
   something the crew stole from the set of the inevitable remake of
   "Logan's Run."

   Perry rode a massive feline into the University of Phoenix Stadium in
   Glendale, Arizona, while singing her chart topper (what else?) "Roar."
   However, the Internet wasn't exactly sure if the animal was a lion, a
   tiger or some hideous mutation of the two. (I would have called it a
   "tion.") [120]According to The Washington Post, a Twitter debate about
   the statue's species erupted during the show and another meme was born.

   A story that [121]appeared on Sports Illustrated's Extra Mustard blog
   in March 2015 featured an interview with the artists who designed and
   built the float, and they confirmed it was a lion. That should have
   ended the debate, but the memes continued to roll in, much to the
   chagrin of Detroit Lions fans, who couldn't escape all the jokes about
   how this was the only time a "Lion" would appear at the Super Bowl.

The Super Bowl shuffle

   In 1985, the Internet might not have been accessible to people without
   computer science doctorates, but those who would help build its most
   revered icons of mockery held on to the memory of this '80s rap anthem
   long enough to make it even more famous on the Web.

   The Chicago Bears went to Super Bowl XX at the end of their stellar
   '85-'86 season, when they beat the New England Patriots to take home
   their first and only Lombardi trophy. Bears wide receiver Willie Gault
   got the bright idea to do a rap song before the big game to celebrate
   the team's season and raise money for a good cause. The song not only
   did that, it also became a certified hit, going platinum and even
   grabbing a Grammy nomination for best rhythm and blues performance by a
   group (it lost to Prince's "Kiss").

   When the music video found its way to YouTube, parodies starting
   popping up, like the "[123]Super Broker Shuffle" used to promote the
   Southern Food Brokerage Corporation. Another send-up starred members of
   the Chicago Bears Shufflin' Crew, including head coach Mike Ditka, in a
   new, commercial version on Funny or Die called "[124]The Boost Mobile
   Shuffle." The Comedy Central sketch-show "[125]Key & Peele," which
   became a hit due in part to its massive presence on YouTube, even
   spoofed the one-hit wonder using the ludicrously named players from
   their "East-West Bowl" series.

The Nannerpuss

   This breakfast creation looks like Cthulhu if he were part of a
   complete breakfast, but it was actually created for a short but
   effective Super Bowl commercial.

   Diner chain Denny's bought time for its first Super Bowl ad to run
   during Super Bowl XLIII in 2009. The advertising agency Denny's hired
   came up with [127]a 15-second ad that opened with the goofy breakfast
   creation before a title card crushed him and the voice of Burt Reynolds
   asked, "Isn't it about time for a serious breakfast?"

   The goal may have been to get people to pay attention to the second
   half of the commercial, but the Internet glommed on to the first half.
   The term Nannerpuss earned an official entry in the [128]Urban
   Dictionary. The character also became the focus of [129]a Facebook
   page, which scored a bunch of followers when the 'puss became a
   candidate for the 2012 presidential election. A knit version of
   Nannerpuss also went viral after popping up on [130]a Craftster forum.

How well do you know your Super Bowl ads? Quiz yourself

Isaiah 'The Old Spice Guy' Mustafa

   Old Spice practically reinvented its image with its [132]2010 Super
   Bowl ad. The spot featured a shirtless Isaiah Mustafa as some kind of
   magical being who could alter time and space, changing clams into
   diamonds and suddenly appearing on a horse.

   The ad became a viral hit, and Mustafa became a meme, thanks to lines
   like "Look at your man, now back at me" and "I'm on a horse." Meme
   makers co-opted the lines for their various causes and critiques. The
   ad also became the target of video parodies by YouTube users and shows
   like "[133]Sesame Street" that featured a version with lovable, furry
   old Grover teaching impressionable viewers about proper use of the
   preposition "on."

Unflattering Beyonce

   The Internet loves taking celebrities down a peg or two. Beyonce found
   herself in the spotlight for the wrong reason when she became a meme
   during Super Bowl XLVII in 2013.

   She and her former Destiny's Child bandmates reunited for the halftime
   show, and the cameras caught her making an unflattering face that
   looked like she got a big, juicy taste of sweaty gym sock. Memes
   started popping up featuring Beyonce's unconventional mug Photoshopped
   onto images of [135]Sylvester Stallone's Rambo and actor Michael
   Ironside on the movie poster for "[136]Scanners." One enterprising
   Photoshopper used the image to turn Beyonce into [137]Dr. Zoidberg from
   "Futurama." It only got worse (or better, depending on your point of
   view) when [138]Beyonce's publicist pulled a total Kanye by trying to
   remove the unflattering images of her client from the Internet.

Wrong lyrics, Christina

   If you become a national pop sensation and you're asked to sing the
   national anthem where cameras are present, make sure you know the
   lyrics backward and forward, or the Internet will make you wish you
   did. [140]Singer Christina Aguilera learned that lesson in 2011 when
   she messed up some of the lyrics to "The Star-Spangled Banner" before
   the start of Super Bowl XLV.

   She later apologized for her mistake, but the Internet used the moment
   to celebrate every misheard lyric in pop song history with a series of
   memes dubbed "Wrong Lyrics Christina." The memes featured a head shot
   of the "Genie in a Bottle" singer on a pink background in midnote as
   she twisted the lyrics of songs like Elton John's "Tiny Dancer" into
   "Hold me closer, Tony Danza" and Rihanna's "Only Girl" into "Want to
   make you feel, like I'm the only squirrel in the world."

Sad Richard Sherman

   Seattle Seahawks' all-star cornerback Richard Sherman achieved Internet
   infamy in 2014 when he went off on San Francisco 49ers wide receiver
   Michael Crabtree in a postgame interview with Fox's Erin Andrews. Even
   though the Seahawks went on to win Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014, Sherman's
   infamous trash talking became a meme and Sherman critics were squirming
   in their Starters to get another chance to use Photoshop to stick it to
   him.

   They got their chance the following year when the Seahawks lost Super
   Bowl XLIX to the New England Patriots and cameras captured Sherman's
   shocked face when he witnessed [142]the Pats' Malcolm Butler intercept
   a pass on the 1-yard line that ended Seattle's chances of achieving
   back-to-back NFL championships. Meme makers didn't just use Sherman's
   look of pure, unflinching horror to throw some of Sherman's trash
   talking back in his horrified face. They also used the moment to
   express their displeasure over other minor inconveniences such as being
   charged extra for using guacamole as a topping at restaurants.

Seahawks' coach Pete Carroll

   Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman may have gotten ribbed following
   the team's Super Bowl loss in 2015, but head coach Pete Carroll
   received two extra scoops of meme hate.

   Carroll became a prime meme target on account of his bewildering
   decision, with only four points keeping his team from a Super Bowl win,
   to pass the ball at the goal line instead of running it in. The
   Internet lambasted Carroll with memes featuring his smiling mug behind
   captions like "Second and goal?/YOLO" and "Superbowl win/Nah, I'll
   pass."

   A photo later surfaced of the coach serving as a guest barista at a
   Seattle Starbucks as part of a benefit for his charity A Better
   Seattle. Pretty much all of the subsequent riffs ran with the same joke
   about whether he should hand the coffee to customers or "step back five
   yards and throw it for no reason."

Super Bowl blackout

   Super Bowl XLVII, in 2013, had a bit of an interruption that would have
   been hard for anyone to pardon. The game took place at the Superdome in
   New Orleans. At the 1:38 mark of the third quarter, a transformer blew
   out, causing the entire west side of the stadium to go dark and stay
   that way for more than 30 minutes, [145]according to an in-depth
   feature by Sports Illustrated's Greg Bishop.

   Everyone watching at home also witnessed the midgame blackout, and
   people ran to their computers to turn the city's most embarrassing
   moment in sports history (if you don't count the New Orleans Saints'
   dismal 1980 season) into meme gold.

   Some memes juxtaposed the blackout with famous movie scenes, like Clark
   Griswold trying to light his Christmas display in "National Lampoon's
   Christmas Vacation" or Johnny from "Airplane!" pulling out the plug to
   the runway lights just before looking to the camera and remarking "just
   kidding." Others simply featured pictures of pure black with the
   caption "Super Bowl XLVII."
