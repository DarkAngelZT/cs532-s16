IPL 2016: Top 5 Hot Buys for This Year's Season

   Here are some of the probable top hot buys for this year's IPL auction.
   Yuvraj Singh:
   [75]Yuvraj-Singh
   To say Yuvraj Singh is an IPL veteran would be putting it mildly. He
   has played for four teams, (Kings XI Punjab, Pune Warriors India, Royal
   Challengers Bangalore and Delhi Daredevils) played 98 matches and
   scored 2099 runs. He even has 35 wickets to his credit. He was the
   costliest player amid IPL 8 when Delhi Daredevil purchased him for a
   record Rs 16 crore, before dumping him in a year. Presently, among the
   eight marquee players, Yuvraj he is good to go for perhaps his fifth
   team and will without a doubt be much looked for in the wake of, having
   made his worldwide return. Who knows, we might witness another offering
   war!
   Base Bid: Rs 2,00,00,000
   Martin Guptill:
   [76]Martin-Guptill


    There are a few beguiling things about the IPL — gaudy outfits being
   only one.
   Be that as it may, one secret that tops everything is the reason a
   player like Martin Guptill hasn't played IPL yet. Guptill had a
   splendid 2015 and a phenomenal running in the World Cup where he turned
   into the primary New Zealand player to score a double century. With two
   new teams and the Kiwi expanding on his last year's form to gather 252
   keeps running from five T20s this year at an average of 63 and strike
   rate of 181.29 (notwithstanding his fabulous run in ODIS), this could
   be the year we at long last see Guptill in the IPL.
   Base Bid: Rs 50,00,000
   Kevin Pietersen:
   [77]Kevin-Pietersen
   Kevin Pietersen has had a long-standing association with the IPL. When
   he made his debut in 2009, the English player was the costliest buy,
   playing for the Royal Challengers Bangalore. In 2015, when England said
   that he wasn't a piece of their arrangements, he set out toward the
   IPL. Presently all the more an independent T20 player, Pietersen has
   been making happy in Caribbean Premiere League and Big Bash League.
   Truth be told, Pietersen was extraordinary for Melbourne Stars in the
   most recent version of BBL, completing as the third most noteworthy
   run-getter. With no worldwide commitments, he will be accessible for
   the full release and establishments are certain to battle it out to
   have the talisman in their group.
   Base Bid: Rs 2,00,00,000
   Dale Steyn:
   [78]Dale-Steyn
   At the point when a quick bowler like Dale Steyn is in the bartering
   line-up, variables such as age, structure, consistency don't make a
   difference. Having a threatening global pacer who can rundown, hit the
   deck hard and scowl at the batsmen for his distributed four overs is an
   offer few IPL groups, new or old, can scarcely cannot. Add to that
   Steyn's accomplishment in the IPL with 92 wickets and his turnaround
   for Sunrisers Hyderabad, the interest for the marquee player may make
   the off-field closeout as energizing his knocking down some pins.
   Base Bid: 1,50,00,000
   Shane Watson:
   [79]Shane-Watson
   Another IPL veteran, who has been a devoted Royal for previous
   championships Rajasthan Royals, ended up in the IPL barters after his
   team was suspended and the establishments, particularly the debutants,
   will take a gander at this as a chance to have a player of his
   expertise and experience on board. Watson is likewise supported by his
   better than average Big Bash League exhibitions where he was the second
   most elevated run-getter for Sydney Thunder.
   Base Bid: Rs 2,00,00,000
