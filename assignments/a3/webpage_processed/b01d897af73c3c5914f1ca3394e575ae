            I've been married to my high school sweetheart for over twenty-five
            years, and have three kids, two boys and one girl. Plus I'm a proud
            grandpa. I served in the Air Force during the first Gulf War. I love
            writing fast action books that are rich with imagination. The Blood
            Tithe series is a wonderful and exciting story.
            Thank you for looking.

   In the damp, dark forest of northern Maine, a secret that was buried

   heartbeats from a distance, feel sap moving in trees.  Best of all, he
   can gather energy from every living thing, which gives him unnatural
   and sometimes uncontrollable powers.

   their affection.  Soon the CIA hears of the news and starts asking
   questions, as do mysterious people who are still alive from the
   original experiments.  Jeremy doesn’t know who to trust.

THE SOUL COLLECTOR

  Science fiction/fantasy
  Forest-covered mountains had formed around Lake Tahoe, guarding the
  massive lake and its only island. For thousands of years the still
  waters held a dark and treacherous secret. Things were happening that
  no one could explain. Fog would defy the elements and spread against
  the wind. The trees were rumored to whisper and cry during the moonless
  nights. Large, black crows were sentinels of the island. Millions of
  spiders the pawns.
  An eerie voice called all ventured to close to the icy waters that
  surrounded the island. It called them to come to the rocky landmass.
  If they didn't drown during the swim, madness took them over within
  seconds of touching the the cursed place.
  Now one woman, Elizabeth Knight will take on the evil forces. She will
  battle a being as old as time itself.
  But is she winning or is she just a puppet?

         set free. The Lord of the Underworld is a demon like no other. He
         devours his human prey without mercy or remorse.
         Elizabeth Knight thought that she defeated the demon, Legion, a
         lifetime ago. However, for demons, time is an endless thing and they
         are only waiting for the next step. Legion manages to get two of his
         servants off the cursed island and they start doing his bidding.
         Elizabeth is at her new home, halfway between Earth and heaven. She
         discovers that the demons are on the move and begs to return in the
         flesh. Her husband John is allowed to join her as they come back to
         Earth for another battle. Elizabeth’s loyal friend, Father Timmony, is
         there to help them. He comes with stern warnings, begging them to go to
