Beyoncé's Dancers Pay Tribute to Mario Woods, Black Man Shot by SFPD

     Beyonce's dancers paid tribute to [61]#MarioWoods, black man killed

   After finishing their halftime Super Bowl routine, Beyoncé's dancers
   [66]held up a sign for cameras paying homage to Mario Woods, a black
   man who was [67]controversially shot 15 times by San Francisco police
   officers.

   Fifty miles from where Woods was shot, the dancers raised their fists
   in a way that recalled the Black Panthers, who were founded across the
   bay in Oakland in 1966. The dancers also appeared to wear Black Panther
   inspired clothing.

     Look at how glorious this picture is of Queen Beyonce and her backup
     dancers. [68]— Miriti Murungi (@NutmegRadio) [69]February 8, 2016

   On December 2, Woods was cornered by five police officers after
   stabbing a man. The incident has garnered attention from activists who
   have labeled it an abuse of power by the SFPD. Local NAACP chapter
   president [70]Amos Brown said that the act "happened because of a
   culture of neglect when it comes to black folks. That's what's coming
   home to haunt us." Perhaps most chillingly, [71]Woods' last words were
   reportedly, "you better squeeze that motherfucker and kill me."

   Justice for Mario Woods Coalition protesters [72]have showed up to
   protest several Super Bowl events in the Bay Area during the week. San
   Francisco mayor Ed Lee has also not escaped scrutiny as a result of the
   incident. Recently, [73]he called for a federal investigation into the
   killing.

   The man who Woods stabbed [74]has even come out and expressed sympathy
   for Woods' family, saying, "Ms. Woods, my heart goes out to you,"
   adding that he would even like to meet her at some point.
