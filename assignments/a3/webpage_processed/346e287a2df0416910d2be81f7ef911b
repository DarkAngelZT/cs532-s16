[23]The Jungle Book New Big Game Trailer Debuts During #SuperBowl50

   IFRAME: [24]embed_3616053_797608

   Disney debuts new trailer for its hopefully less racist live-action
   version of The Jungle Book.
   See the legend come to life in 3D, Real D 3D, and IMAX 3D on April 15!
   üêªüêØüêµüêç
   From YT:
   Directed by Jon Favreau (‚ÄúIron Man‚Äù), based on Rudyard Kipling‚Äôs
   timeless stories and inspired by Disney‚Äôs classic animated film, ‚ÄúThe
   Jungle Book‚Äù is an all-new live-action epic adventure about Mowgli
   (newcomer Neel Sethi), a man-cub who‚Äôs been raised by a family of
   wolves. But Mowgli finds he is no longer welcome in the jungle when
   fearsome tiger Shere Khan (voice of Idris Elba), who bears the scars of
   Man, promises to eliminate what he sees as a threat. Urged to abandon
   the only home he‚Äôs ever known, Mowgli embarks on a captivating journey
   of self-discovery, guided by panther-turned-stern mentor Bagheera
   (voice of Ben Kingsley), and the free-spirited bear Baloo (voice of
   Bill Murray). Along the way, Mowgli encounters jungle creatures who
   don‚Äôt exactly have his best interests at heart, including Kaa (voice of
   Scarlett Johansson), a python whose seductive voice and gaze hypnotizes
   the man-cub, and the smooth-talking King Louie (voice of Christopher
   Walken), who tries to coerce Mowgli into giving up the secret to the
   elusive and deadly red flower: fire. The all-star cast also includes
   Lupita Nyong'o as the voice of the fiercely protective mother wolf
   Raksha, and Giancarlo Esposito as the voice of wolf pack‚Äôs alpha male
   Akela. ‚ÄúThe Jungle Book‚Äù seamlessly blends live-action with
   photorealistic CGI animals and environments, using up-to-the-minute
   technology and storytelling techniques to immerse audiences in an
   enchanting and lush world.

   She's somehow known for her sultry, breathy, Old Hollywood-esque voice,
   but she sounds so monotone most of the time. I'd argue that she isn't
   actually a horrible choice for this, but she sounds like she's not even
   trying.

   I really like the dark angle of the story, and I was with this until I
   heard the terrible voice-overs (I'm looking at you ScarJo and
   Christopher Walken) and the weird pop culture/modern life references
   ("Not full hibernation but I nap a lot")
   But the visuals are pretty stunning. I'm torn.

   Evidently since orangutans aren't native to India, they wanted to go
   with something a little more realistic.
   So they chose a Gigantopithecus, a species of ape that has been extinct
   for 100,000 years.

   I....
   The CGI looks atrocious. The shot where Bagheera tackled him in the
   beginning gave me straight up Spider-Man 2001 vibes. And don't even
   start with it's a trailer, it's probably not finished! you know full
   goddamn well it's not going to look much better than that in the final
   product.
   I lost it at the mafia don King Louie. whyyyyyyyyyyyy
   They should have put at least some modulation on Scarlett's voice. It
   doesn't fit at all.
