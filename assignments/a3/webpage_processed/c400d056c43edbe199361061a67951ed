Rules

   hover for details
   No non-ragecomics allowed If you aren't telling a story, there are no
   characters, action, or similar, then its not a rage comic. This
   includes comics ending in [130]AdviceAnimals
   No comparison comics These are comics that compare one thing to
   another. If you're making any comparison in your comic, chances are
   you're doing it wrong
   No reposting This subreddit is for original content only, meaning
   comics YOU made. Don't post stuff you found from elsewhere on the web,
   it's probably been here already. And don't resubmit your comic because
   it did poorly. Reposting will result in a ban
   Upvotes don't matter It doesn't matter if your comic has 1.21
   Gigavotes, we can and will remove it if it violates any of the rules
   No meta-posts Don't make a comic complaining about another user, comic,
   or the moderators. Additionally, don't make comics to ‚Äúintroduce‚Äù a new
   rageface
   NSFW tags are free Please use NSFW tags for anything that might have
   the remote possibility of getting someone fired or in trouble
   Comics must be between 2 and 8 panels Your comic must be between 2 and
   8 panels long. We don't want single panels, nor do we want novels. No
   comics made of double-width panels only
   No blogposts Blogposts are preachy, self-serving, boring comics. These
   often take the form of a full-panel stare face lecturing someone, posts
   about how your dog/cat/grandpa died, and similar. Your post must be
   relatable, not a personal anecdote
   No vote-begging Do not mention cakedays, karma, upvotes, or anything
   similar
   Be light on text People come here for quick, simple humor. If you find
   your comic heavy on words, try submitting it to [131]/r/ragenovels.
   This includes labeling ‚Äùpoorly drawn televisions‚Äù and similar
   No non-imgur images If your comic is from some site other than imgur,
   then its not permitted, and will be removed as spam. Also, please link
   directly to the image
   No dead horse beating Avoid tropes of rage comics, including, but not
   limited to le, das, moi, true story, [FIRST], Extra Panel, Made for
   reddit, and [FIXED]
   Mods have the final say If a comic is removed by a moderator, even if
   it doesn't seem to violate any of the other rules, it remains removed
     __________________________________________________________________

FAQ

   hover for details
   Why isn't my comic on the "new" tab? Give it a second. It was probably
   caught by the evil robotic spam filter, but we've created an even more
   powerful robot to save everything from the filter; it just can take a
   couple minutes. If it still doesn't work, it was probably removed for
   breaking a rule (read them!).
   Can I be a moderator, too? As much as we love when community members
   want to help out, we can't accept requests for becoming moderators, or
   we'd be overwhelmed with nothing but such requests. Therefore,
   requesting to be a moderator will actually result in you getting banned
   instead. When we feel we need more moderators, we recruit from a list
   of people we have identified as being helpful and positive role models
   for the community. If you want to be a mod one day, that's how you'll
   go about doing it
   How do I get flair? If you ask for flair, we will never give it to you,
   no matter how many blowjobs you offer

   it had to happen like that; always sucks when someone underlines why
   they are awful and not worth your time.

   Why thank you, I'm not sure but I'm thinking that I actually invented
   that word 10 years ago. But then again I thought that I invented the
   the word sheeple, I've been using it since I was a teenager 18 years
   ago. But people have been saying it since the 60s according to this
   random 1st gen. hippie group I met at a concert. I wonder if I just
   randomly hear these words and never remember it, or if I'm just very
   talented in making up words that other people made up a long time
   before me. I'm not even joking I came up with those all on my own as
   far as I know.

   Count your blessings that you do not have a head full of spiders like
   she does. Seriously, think of how neurotic and weird inside she must be
   to have issues like that. And her willingness to inflict them on others
   means that she is losing control over them and may soon burst like an
   infected appendix.

   Don't be surprised if you get a late night, crying, begging, ranting
   and pleading phone call soon. Don't go, but call her local police
   non-emergency number and ask them to make a "welfare check" on her.

   Spoiler alert [316]u/bedpan3, [317]u/MrBojanglesIsHi is really your
   "friend" on reddit....

   in all seriousness, I'm so glad that Bojangles has never had to deal
   with an emotional vampire to the point that they have no empathy or
   anything for a frame of reference, but that said, it probably means
   they indeed are the emotional vampire themselves.

   it's because you sound like a bitch.

   I don't feel like a prey. . . .I don't offer a gift with expectations.
   . . .Nor do I judge a "friend" when they're down and in new waters.
   This is reddit. He is moaning about doing something he choose to do.
   But in all reality, i have no idea what their life situations are & i
   should not have spoken in such vulgarity.

   P.s. learn to walk alone as so you can walk away from things that don't
   feel right vampire grace of princess decent

   It's right over there ====>

   Also, on #7...

     No comics made of double-width panels only.

   I would argue that OPs comic is only double-width panels, though I'm
   not even sure if one could argue there are even panels present.
